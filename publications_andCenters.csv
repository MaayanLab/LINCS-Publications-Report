The MT-SDREM networks were also better at identifying proteins whose removal affects viral load indicating that joint learning can still lead to accurate, condition-specific, networks.

LCB implements two compacted layered canvases, one to visualize clustered L1000 expression data, and the other to display enrichment analysis results using 30 different gene set libraries. Clicking on an experimental condition highlights gene-sets enriched for the differentially expressed genes from the selected experiment. A search interface allows users to input gene lists and query them against over 100 000 conditions to find the top matching experiments. The tool integrates many resources for an unprecedented potential for new discoveries in systems biology and systems pharmacology.

119,"BACKGROUND: Soluble growth factors present in the microenvironment play a major role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis, and responsiveness to targeted therapies. While the biochemistry of growth factor-dependent signal transduction has been studied extensively in individual cell types, relatively little systematic data are available across genetically diverse cell lines. RESULTS: We describe a quantitative and comparative dataset focused on immediate-early signaling that regulates the AKT (AKT1/2/3) and ERK (MAPK1/3) pathways in a canonical panel of well-characterized breast cancer lines. We also provide interactive web-based tools to facilitate follow-on analysis of the data. Our findings show that breast cancers are diverse with respect to ligand sensitivity and signaling biochemistry. Surprisingly, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs; which express low levels of ErbB2, progesterone and estrogen receptors) are the most broadly responsive to growth factors and HER2amp cancers (which overexpress ErbB2) the least. The ratio of ERK to AKT activation varies with ligand and subtype, with a systematic bias in favor of ERK in hormone receptor positive (HR+) cells. The factors that correlate with growth factor responsiveness depend on whether fold-change or absolute activity is considered the key biological variable, and they differ between ERK and AKT pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Responses to growth factors are highly diverse across breast cancer cell lines, even within the same subtype.

125,"BACKGROUND: Soluble growth factors present in the microenvironment play a major role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis, and responsiveness to targeted therapies. While the biochemistry of growth factor-dependent signal transduction has been studied extensively in individual cell types, relatively little systematic data are available across genetically diverse cell lines.

Our findings show that breast cancers are diverse with respect to ligand sensitivity and signaling biochemistry.

134,"BACKGROUND: System-wide profiling of genes and proteins in mammalian cells produce lists of differentially expressed genes/proteins that need to be further analyzed for their collective functions in order to extract new knowledge. Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for improvement. RESULTS: Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios.

Our framework integrates ChIP-seq data and appropriately matched gene expression profiles to identify True REGulatory (TREG) TF-gene interactions.

We demonstrate the advantages of TREG framework in identifying genes regulated by two TFs with widely different distribution of functional binding events (ERα and E2f1). We also show that TREG signatures of TF activity vastly improve our ability to detect involvement of ERα in producing complex diseases-related transcriptional profiles. Through a large study of disease-related transcriptional signatures and transcriptional signatures of drug activity, we demonstrate that increase in statistical power associated with the use of TREG signatures makes the crucial difference in identifying key targets for treatment, and drugs to use for treatment.

Drug responses and expression data collected from cell lines and tumors were used to generate tripartite networks connecting clusters of patients to cell lines and cell lines to drugs, to connect drugs to patients. Various approaches were applied to connect cell lines to tumor clusters: a standard method that uses a biomarker gene set, and new methods that compute metasignatures for transcription factors and histone modifications given upregulated genes in cell lines or tumors.

Deregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway occurs commonly in cancer and numerous inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding site of these kinases are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Here, we report the characterization of Torin2, a second-generation ATP-competitive inhibitor that is potent and selective for mTOR with a superior pharmacokinetic profile to previous inhibitors. Torin2 inhibited mTORC1-dependent T389 phosphorylation on S6K (RPS6KB1) with an EC(50) of 250 pmol/L with approximately 800-fold selectivity for cellular mTOR versus phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K).

Similar to the earlier generation compound Torin1 and in contrast to other reported mTOR inhibitors, Torin2 inhibited mTOR kinase and mTORC1 signaling activities in a sustained manner suggestive of a slow dissociation from the kinase.

Torin2 also exhibited potent biochemical and cellular activity against phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-like kinase (PIKK) family kinases including ATM (EC(50), 28 nmol/L), ATR (EC(50), 35 nmol/L), and DNA-PK (EC(50), 118 nmol/L; PRKDC), the inhibition of which sensitized cells to Irradiation. Similar to the earlier generation compound Torin1 and in contrast to other reported mTOR inhibitors, Torin2 inhibited mTOR kinase and mTORC1 signaling activities in a sustained manner suggestive of a slow dissociation from the kinase. Cancer cell treatment with Torin2 for 24 hours resulted in a prolonged block in negative feedback and consequent T308 phosphorylation on Akt. These effects were associated with strong growth inhibition in vitro. Single-agent treatment with Torin2 in vivo did not yield significant efficacy against KRAS-driven lung tumors, but the combination of Torin2 with mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor AZD6244 yielded a significant growth inhibition.

We describe a simple bioanalytical assay platform consisting of a large array of subnanoliter microchambers integrated with high-density antibody barcode microarrays for highly multiplexed protein detection from over a thousand single cells in parallel. This platform has been tested for both cell lines and complex biological samples such as primary cells from patients. We observed distinct heterogeneity among the single cell secretomic signatures that, for the first time, can be directly correlated to the cells' physical behavior such as migration. Compared to the state-of-the-art protein secretion assay such as ELISpot and emerging microtechnology-enabled assays, our approach offers both high throughput and high multiplicity. It also has a number of clinician-friendly features such as ease of operation, low sample consumption, and standardized data analysis, representing a potentially transformative tool for informative monitoring of cellular function and immunity in patients.",0.0,High-throughput secretomic analysis of single cells to assess functional cellular heterogeneity.,1.0,,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.1021/ac400082e,4,Analytical Chemistry,,,23339603.0,PMC3589817,2548-56,28,"{\MATLAB Scripts\"":null}""",0.0,,,0.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,85,2013.0,33,183,Fan R,,222,11.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

251,"MOTIVATION: Networks are vital to computational systems biology research, but visualizing them is a challenge. For networks larger than ∼100 nodes and ∼200 links, ball-and-stick diagrams fail to convey much information. To address this, we developed Network2Canvas (N2C), a web application that provides an alternative way to view networks. N2C visualizes networks by placing nodes on a square toroidal canvas. The network nodes are clustered on the canvas using simulated annealing to maximize local connections where a node's brightness is made proportional to its local fitness. The interactive canvas is implemented in HyperText Markup Language (HTML)5 with the JavaScript library Data-Driven Documents (D3).

390,"Huge amounts of high-throughput screening (HTS) data for probe and drug development projects are being generated in the pharmaceutical industry and more recently in the public sector. The resulting experimental datasets are increasingly being disseminated via publically accessible repositories. However, existing repositories lack sufficient metadata to describe the experiments and are often difficult to navigate by non-experts. The lack of standardized descriptions and semantics of biological assays and screening results hinder targeted data retrieval, integration, aggregation, and analyses across different HTS datasets, for example to infer mechanisms of action of small molecule perturbagens. To address these limitations, we created the BioAssay Ontology (BAO). BAO has been developed with a focus on data integration and analysis enabling the classification of assays and screening results by concepts that relate to format, assay design, technology, target, and endpoint. Previously, we reported on the higher-level design of BAO and on the semantic querying capabilities offered by the ontology-indexed triple store of HTS data. Here, we report on our detailed design, annotation pipeline, substantially enlarged annotation knowledgebase, and analysis results. We used BAO to annotate assays from the largest public HTS data repository, PubChem, and demonstrate its utility to categorize and analyze diverse HTS results from numerous experiments. BAO is publically available from the NCBO BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1533. BAO provides controlled terminology and uniform scope to report probe and drug discovery screening assays and results.

437,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disease primarily characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons, and caused by reduced levels of the SMN protein. Previous studies to understand the proteomic consequences of reduced SMN have mostly utilized patient fibroblasts and animal models. We have derived human motor neurons from type I SMA and healthy controls by creating their induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Quantitative mass spectrometry of these cells revealed increased expression of 63 proteins in control motor neurons compared to respective fibroblasts, whereas 30 proteins were increased in SMA motor neurons vs. their fibroblasts.

This highly reproducible process allowed ~95% of the reduced-representation phosphopeptide probes to be detected in ~200 samples.

498,"Drug sensitivity and resistance are conventionally quantified by IC50 or Emax values, but these metrics are highly sensitive to the number of divisions taking place over the course of a response assay. The dependency of IC50 and Emax on division rate creates artefactual correlations between genotype and drug sensitivity, while obscuring valuable biological insights and interfering with biomarker discovery. We derive alternative small molecule drug-response metrics that are insensitive to division number. These are based on estimation of the magnitude of drug-induced growth rate inhibition (GR) using endpoint or time-course assays. We show that GR50 and GRmax are superior to conventional metrics for assessing the effects of small molecule drugs in dividing cells.

Using experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that pathway-guided results maintain, and often improve, the accuracy of predictors even in cases where the full gene network is unknown.

515,"The cellular composition of a tumor greatly influences the growth, spread, immune activity, drug response, and other aspects of the disease. Tumor cells are usually comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of subclones, each of which could contain their own distinct character. The presence of minor subclones poses a serious health risk for patients as any one of them could harbor a fitness advantage with respect to the current treatment regimen, fueling resistance. It is therefore vital to accurately assess the make-up of cell states within a tumor biopsy. Transcriptome-wide assays from RNA sequencing provide key data from which cell state signatures can be detected. However, the challenge is to find them within samples containing mixtures of cell types of unknown proportions. We propose a novel one-class method based on logistic regression and show that its performance is competitive to two established SVM-based methods for this detection task. We demonstrate that one-class models are able to identify specific cell types in heterogeneous cell populations better than their binary predictor counterparts.

It is particularly useful in studying anti-mitotic drug responses since mitotic arrest provides an activity biomarker. One conventional way to probe mitotic arrest and downstream apoptosis response is to use mitosis- and apoptosis-specific antibodies in cell-based imaging assays. However, weakly attached cells, especially dead cells, are mostly washed out during antibody labeling steps. Here, we report a rapid and convenient one-step cell-imaging assay that accurately measures cell-cycle state and apoptosis in mammalian cells.

The functional target of QL-IX-55 is the ATP-binding site of TOR2 as evidenced by the discovery of resistant alleles of TOR2 through rational design and unbiased selection strategies. QL-IX-55 is capable of potently inhibiting both TOR complex 1 and 2 (TORC1 and TORC2) as demonstrated by biochemical IP kinase assays (IC(50) <50 nM) and cellular assays for inhibition of substrate YPK1 phosphorylation.

We show that KIN-193 is efficacious specifically in blocking AKT signaling and tumor growth that are dependent on p110β activation or PTEN loss.

520,"An intensive recent effort to develop ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors has resulted in several potent and selective molecules such as Torin1, PP242, KU63794, and WYE354. These inhibitors are being widely used as pharmacological probes of mTOR-dependent biology. To determine the potency and specificity of these agents, we have undertaken a systematic kinome-wide effort to profile their selectivity and potency using chemical proteomics and assays for enzymatic activity, protein binding, and disruption of cellular signaling. Enzymatic and cellular assays revealed that all four compounds are potent inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2, with Torin1 exhibiting ∼20-fold greater potency for inhibition of Thr-389 phosphorylation on S6 kinases (EC(50) = 2 nM) relative to other inhibitors. In vitro biochemical profiling at 10 μM revealed binding of PP242 to numerous kinases, although WYE354 and KU63794 bound only to p38 kinases and PI3K isoforms and Torin1 to ataxia telangiectasia mutated, ATM and Rad3-related protein, and DNA-PK. Analysis of these protein targets in cellular assays did not reveal any off-target activities for Torin1, WYE354, and KU63794 at concentrations below 1 μM but did show that PP242 efficiently inhibited the RET receptor (EC(50), 42 nM) and JAK1/2/3 kinases (EC(50), 780 nM). In addition, Torin1 displayed unusually slow kinetics for inhibition of the mTORC1/2 complex, a property likely to contribute to the pharmacology of this inhibitor. Our results demonstrated that, with the exception of PP242, available ATP-competitive compounds are highly selective mTOR inhibitors when applied to cells at concentrations below 1 μM and that the compounds may represent a starting point for medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at developing inhibitors of other PI3K kinase-related kinases.",0.0,Kinome-wide selectivity profiling of ATP-competitive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and characterization of their binding kinetics.,0.0,,1.0,,6/22/16 0:00,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1074/jbc.M111.304485,287,Journal of Biological Chemistry,,,22223645.0,PMC3322972,9742-52,70,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,13,2012.0,39,438,"Liu Q, Kirubakaran S, Hur W, Niepel M, Westover K, Thoreen CC, Wang J, Ni J, Patricelli MP, Vogel K, Riddle S, Waller DL, Traynor R, Sanda T, Zhao Z, Kang SA, Zhao J, Look AT, Sorger PK, Sabatini DM, Gray NS",,576,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At the same time, curation projects that organize knowledge from the biomedical literature into online databases are expanding. Hence, there is a wealth of information about genes, proteins and their associations, with an urgent need for data integration to achieve better knowledge extraction and data reuse. For this purpose, we developed the Harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins from over 70 major online resources. We extracted, abstracted and organized data into ∼72 million functional associations between genes/proteins and their attributes. Such attributes could be physical relationships with other biomolecules, expression in cell lines and tissues, genetic associations with knockout mouse or human phenotypes, or changes in expression after drug treatment. We stored these associations in a relational database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins, their attributes and the original resources. The freely available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user interface, a web service and a mobile app for querying, browsing and downloading all of the collected data. To demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome, we computed and visualized gene-gene and attribute-attribute similarity networks, and through unsupervised clustering, identified many unexpected relationships by combining pairs of datasets such as the association between kinase perturbations and disease signatures. We also applied supervised machine learning methods to predict novel substrates for kinases, endogenous ligands for G-protein coupled receptors, mouse phenotypes for knockout genes, and classified unannotated transmembrane proteins for likelihood of being ion channels. The Harmonizome is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and proteins, and as such, it enables researchers to discover novel relationships between biological entities, as well as form novel data-driven hypotheses for experimental validation.Database URL: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome.",1.0,The Harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins.,0.0,,1.0,,7/28/16 0:00,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1093/database/baw100,,Database (Oxford),,,27374120.0,PMC4930834,,73,"{\Harmonizome\"":\""http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,baw100,2016.0,38,441,"Rouillard AD, Gundersen GW, Fernandez NF, Wang Z, Monteiro CD, McDermott MG, Ma'ayan A",,579,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
523,"The library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) L1000 data set currently comprises of over a million gene expression profiles of chemically perturbed human cell lines. Through unique several intrinsic and extrinsic benchmarking schemes, we demonstrate that processing the L1000 data with the characteristic direction (CD) method significantly improves signal to noise compared with the MODZ method currently used to compute L1000 signatures. The CD processed L1000 signatures are served through a state-of-the-art web-based search engine application called L1000CDS2. The L1000CDS2 search engine provides prioritization of thousands of small-molecule signatures, and their pairwise combinations, predicted to either mimic or reverse an input gene expression signature using two methods. The L1000CDS2 search engine also predicts drug targets for all the small molecules profiled by the L1000 assay that we processed. Targets are predicted by computing the cosine similarity between the L1000 small-molecule signatures and a large collection of signatures extracted from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) for single-gene perturbations in mammalian cells. We applied L1000CDS2 to prioritize small molecules that are predicted to reverse expression in 670 disease signatures also extracted from GEO, and prioritized small molecules that can mimic expression of 22 endogenous ligand signatures profiled by the L1000 assay. As a case study, to further demonstrate the utility of L1000CDS2, we collected expression signatures from human cells infected with Ebola virus at 30, 60 and 120 min. Querying these signatures with L1000CDS2 we identified kenpaullone, a GSK3B/CDK2 inhibitor that we show, in subsequent experiments, has a dose-dependent efficacy in inhibiting Ebola infection in vitro without causing cellular toxicity in human cell lines.

524,"RNA-seq analysis is becoming a standard method for global gene expression profiling. However, open and standard pipelines to perform RNA-seq analysis by non-experts remain challenging due to the large size of the raw data files and the hardware requirements for running the alignment step. Here we introduce a reproducible open source RNA-seq pipeline delivered as an IPython notebook and a Docker image. The pipeline uses state-of-the-art tools and can run on various platforms with minimal configuration overhead. The pipeline enables the extraction of knowledge from typical RNA-seq studies by generating interactive principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HC) plots, performing enrichment analyses against over 90 gene set libraries, and obtaining lists of small molecules that are predicted to either mimic or reverse the observed changes in mRNA expression. We apply the pipeline to a recently published RNA-seq dataset collected from human neuronal progenitors infected with the Zika virus (ZIKV). In addition to confirming the presence of cell cycle genes among the genes that are downregulated by ZIKV, our analysis uncovers significant overlap with upregulated genes that when knocked out in mice induce defects in brain morphology. This result potentially points to the molecular processes associated with the microcephaly phenotype observed in newborns from pregnant mothers infected with the virus. In addition, our analysis predicts small molecules that can either mimic or reverse the expression changes induced by ZIKV.

We recently demonstrated that a new class of human U1-like snRNAs, the variant (v)U1 snRNAs (vU1s), also participate in pre-mRNA processing events. In this study, we show that several human vU1 genes are specifically upregulated in stem cells and participate in the regulation of cell fate decisions. Significantly, ectopic expression of vU1 genes in human skin fibroblasts leads to increases in levels of key pluripotent stem cell mRNA markers, including NANOG and SOX2. These results reveal an important role for vU1s in the control of key regulatory networks orchestrating the transitions between stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Moreover, vU1 expression varies inversely with U1 expression during differentiation and cell re-programming and this pattern of expression is specifically de-regulated in iPSC-derived motor neurons from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) type 1 patient's.

Key features include maximizing uniform cell growth during the assay period, accounting for the effects of cell density on response, and correcting sensitivity measures for differences in proliferation rates. Two related protocols are described: one involves an endpoint measure well-suited to large-scale studies and the second is a time-dependent measurement that reveals changes in response over time. The methods can be adapted to other types of plate-based experiments.",1.0,Measuring cancer drug sensitivity and resistance in cultured cells.,1.0,,1.0,,10/20/17 0:00,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.1002/cpch.21,2,Current Protocols in Chemical Biology,,,28628199.0,PMC5538315,55-74,174,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,9,2017.0,6,542,"Niepel M, Hafner M, Chung M, Sorger PK",,683,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
537,"More effective use of targeted anti-cancer drugs depends on elucidating the connection between the molecular states induced by drug treatment and the cellular phenotypes controlled by these states, such as cytostasis and death. This is particularly true when mutation of a single gene is inadequate as a predictor of drug response. The current paper describes a data set of ~600 drug cell line pairs collected as part of the NIH LINCS Program ( http://www.lincsproject.org/ ) in which molecular data (reduced dimensionality transcript L1000 profiles) were recorded across dose and time in parallel with phenotypic data on cellular cytostasis and cytotoxicity. We report that transcriptional and phenotypic responses correlate with each other in general, but whereas inhibitors of chaperones and cell cycle kinases induce similar transcriptional changes across cell lines, changes induced by drugs that inhibit intra-cellular signaling kinases are cell-type specific. In some drug/cell line pairs significant changes in transcription are observed without a change in cell growth or survival; analysis of such pairs identifies drug equivalence classes and, in one case, synergistic drug interactions. In this case, synergy involves cell-type specific suppression of an adaptive drug response.",1.0,Common and cell-type specific responses to anti-cancer drugs revealed by high throughput transcript profiling.,0.0,,1.0,,11/3/17 0:00,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1038/s41467-017-01383-w,1,Nature Communications,,,29084964.0,PMC5662764,1186,184,"{\LINCS Joint Project - Breast Cancer Network Browser (LJP-BCNB)\"":\""http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/LJP/\""}""",0.0,,,1.0,1.0,,86,2017.0,2,552,"Niepel M, Hafner M, Duan Q, Wang Z, Paull EO, Chung M, Lu X, Stuart JM, Golub TR, Subramanian A, Ma'ayan A, Sorger PK",,693,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
538,"Traditional means for scoring the effects of anti-cancer drugs on the growth and survival of cell lines is based on relative cell number in drug-treated and control samples and is seriously confounded by unequal division rates arising from natural biological variation and differences in culture conditions. This problem can be overcome by computing drug sensitivity on a per-division basis. The normalized growth rate inhibition (GR) approach yields per-division metrics for drug potency (GR50) and efficacy (GRmax) that are analogous to the more familiar IC50 and Emax values. In this work, we report GR-based, proliferation-corrected, drug sensitivity metrics for ~4,700 pairs of breast cancer cell lines and perturbagens. Such data are broadly useful in understanding the molecular basis of therapeutic response and resistance. Here, we use them to investigate the relationship between different measures of drug sensitivity and conclude that drug potency and efficacy exhibit high variation that is only weakly correlated.

540,"Extrinsic signals are implicated in breast cancer resistance to HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). To examine how microenvironmental signals influence resistance, we monitored TKI-treated breast cancer cell lines grown on microenvironment microarrays composed of printed extracellular matrix proteins supplemented with soluble proteins. We tested ∼2,500 combinations of 56 soluble and 46 matrix microenvironmental proteins on basal-like HER2+ (HER2E) or luminal-like HER2+ (L-HER2+) cells treated with the TKIs lapatinib or neratinib. In HER2E cells, hepatocyte growth factor, a ligand for MET, induced resistance that could be reversed with crizotinib, an inhibitor of MET. In L-HER2+ cells, neuregulin1-β1 (NRG1β), a ligand for HER3, induced resistance that could be reversed with pertuzumab, an inhibitor of HER2-HER3 heterodimerization. The subtype-specific responses were also observed in 3D cultures and murine xenografts. These results, along with bioinformatic pathway analysis and siRNA knockdown experiments, suggest different mechanisms of resistance specific to each HER2+ subtype: MET signaling for HER2E and HER2-HER3 heterodimerization for L-HER2+ cells.",0.0,Microenvironment-Mediated Mechanisms of Resistance to HER2 Inhibitors Differ between HER2+ Breast Cancer Subtypes.,1.0,,1.0,,6/15/18 0:00,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1016/j.cels.2018.02.001,6,Cell Systems,,,29550255.0,PMC5927625,329-342,210,,0.0,,17.0,0.0,0.0,,3,2018.0,0,583,"Watson SS, Dane M, Chin K, Tatarova Z, Liu M, Liby T, Thompson W, Smith R, Nederlof M, Bucher E, Kilburn D, Whitman M, Sudar D, Mills GB, Heiser LM, Jonas O, Gray JW, Korkola JE",,729,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
