"Whereas genomic data are universally machine-readable, data from imaging, multiplex biochemistry, flow cytometry and other cell- and tissue-based assays usually reside in loosely organized files of poorly documented provenance. This arises because the relational databases used in genomic research are difficult to adapt to rapidly evolving experimental designs, data formats and analytic algorithms. Here we describe an adaptive approach to managing experimental data based on semantically typed data hypercubes (SDCubes) that combine hierarchical data format 5 (HDF5) and extensible markup language (XML) file types. We demonstrate the application of SDCube-based storage using ImageRail, a software package for high-throughput microscopy. Experimental design and its day-to-day evolution, not rigid standards, determine how ImageRail data are organized in SDCubes. We applied ImageRail to collect and analyze drug dose-response landscapes in human cell lines at single-cell resolution.",0.0,Adaptive informatics for multifactorial and high-content biological data.,0.0,"Niepel M, Sorger PK, Muhlich JL, Millard BL, Menden MP",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,10.1038/nmeth.1600,6,Nature Methods,,21516115.0,PMC3105758,487-93,43.0,"{\SDCubes\"":\""https://github.com/sorgerlab/SDCube_API\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,1.0,5/19/16 18:33,8,2011.0,PMC3105758,"['4133729', '4148203', '3673213', '3270411', '3270111', '4914393', '3832711', '3187564', '5372219', '3322972', '4165886', '4296150', '3783040', '3438894', '5127489', '3760004', '3845839', '3947796', '4949266', '4174537', '4818567', '3564696', '3523717', '3465074', '5148592']",25.0,"[2014, 2014, 2013, 0, 2011, 2016, 2013, 2011, 2016, 2012, 2014, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2016, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2016, 2012, 2015, 2013, 2012, 2012, 2016]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Computational analyses of systematic measurements on the states and activities of signaling proteins (as captured by phosphoproteomic data, for example) have the potential to uncover uncharacterized protein-protein interactions and to identify the subset that are important for cellular response to specific biological stimuli. However, inferring mechanistically plausible protein signaling networks (PSNs) from phosphoproteomics data is a difficult task, owing in part to the lack of sufficiently comprehensive experimental measurements, the inherent limitations of network inference algorithms, and a lack of standards for assessing the accuracy of inferred PSNs. A case study in which 12 research groups inferred PSNs from a phosphoproteomics data set demonstrates an assessment of inferred PSNs on the basis of the accuracy of their predictions. The concurrent prediction of the same previously unreported signaling interactions by different participating teams suggests relevant validation experiments and establishes a framework for combining PSNs inferred by multiple research groups into a composite PSN. We conclude that crowdsourcing the construction of PSNs-that is, outsourcing the task to the interested community-may be an effective strategy for network inference.",0.0,Crowdsourcing network inference: the dream predictive signaling network challenge.,0.0,"Sorger PK, Saez-Rodriguez J, Prill RJ, Alexopoulos LG, Stolovitzky G",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.1126/scisignal.2002212,189,Science Signaling,,21900204.0,PMC3465072,mr7,44.0,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,4,2011.0,PMC3465072,"['3649990', '4611647', '4872295', '4559359', '4945826', '3503555', '5869720', '4015903', '3338013', '5319798', '4318527', '3927870', '5075921', '4514931', '4944831', '3605281', '3777925', '4919846', '5026418', '4485132', '3720774', '3897241', '4664553', '4854847', '5545976', '4447414', '3360688', '3987808', '4070074', '3647006', '3436796', '3972682', '4503556', '4803391', '4133630', '4837986', '4350443', '3716858', '5632288', '4816347', '3529704', '3377689', '3868523', '5860161', '5351548', '4817425', '4013075']",47.0,"[2013, 2015, 2016, 2015, 2015, 2012, 2018, 2013, 2012, 2017, 2014, 2014, 2016, 2015, 2016, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2016, 2015, 2013, 0, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2015, 2012, 2013, 0, 2013, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2015, 2014, 2016, 2015, 2013, 2017, 2016, 2012, 2012, 2013, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"High-content cellomic analysis is a powerful tool for rapid screening of cellular responses to extracellular cues and examination of intracellular signal transduction pathways at the single-cell level. In conjunction with microfluidics technology that provides unique advantages in sample processing and precise control of fluid delivery, it holds great potential to transform lab-on-a-chip systems for high-throughput cellular analysis. However, high-content imaging instruments are expensive, sophisticated, and not readily accessible. Herein, we report on a laser scanning cytometry approach that exploits a bench-top microarray scanner as an end-point reader to perform rapid and automated fluorescence imaging of cells cultured on a chip. Using high-content imaging analysis algorithms, we demonstrated multiplexed measurements of morphometric and proteomic parameters from all single cells. Our approach shows the improvement of both sensitivity and dynamic range by two orders of magnitude as compared to conventional epifluorescence microscopy. We applied this technology to high-throughput analysis of mesenchymal stem cells on an extracellular matrix protein array and characterization of heterotypic cell populations. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a laser microarray scanner for high-content cellomic analysis and opens up new opportunities to conduct informative cellular analysis and cell-based screening in the lab-on-a-chip systems.",0.0,High-content single cell analysis on chip using a laser microarray scanner.,0.0,"Wu Y, Fan R, Zhou J, Lee SK",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.1039/c2lc40309a,23,Lab on a Chip,,22991099.0,,5025-33,42.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,12,2012.0,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Clinical responses to anticancer therapies are often restricted to a subset of patients. In some cases, mutated cancer genes are potent biomarkers for responses to targeted agents. Here, to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines--which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers--with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies.",0.0,Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells.,0.0,"Zhang T, Gray NS, Benes CH, Liu Q, Hur W, Garnett MJ, Edelman EJ, Heidorn SJ,

"Huge amounts of high-throughput screening (HTS) data for probe and drug development projects are being generated in the pharmaceutical industry and more recently in the public sector. The resulting experimental datasets are increasingly being disseminated via publically accessible repositories. However, existing repositories lack sufficient metadata to describe the experiments and are often difficult to navigate by non-experts. The lack of standardized descriptions and semantics of biological assays and screening results hinder targeted data retrieval, integration, aggregation, and analyses across different HTS datasets, for example to infer mechanisms of action of small molecule perturbagens. To address these limitations, we created the BioAssay Ontology (BAO). BAO has been developed with a focus on data integration and analysis enabling the classification of assays and screening results by concepts that relate to format, assay design, technology, target, and endpoint. Previously, we reported on the higher-level design of BAO and on the semantic querying capabilities offered by the ontology-indexed triple store of HTS data. Here, we report on our detailed design, annotation pipeline, substantially enlarged annotation knowledgebase, and analysis results. We used BAO to annotate assays from the largest public HTS data repository, PubChem, and demonstrate its utility to categorize and analyze diverse HTS results from numerous experiments. BAO is publically available from the NCBO BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1533. BAO provides controlled terminology and uniform scope to report probe and drug discovery screening assays and results.

"BACKGROUND: The skeleton of complex systems can be represented as networks where vertices represent entities, and edges represent the relations between these entities. Often it is impossible, or expensive, to determine the network structure by experimental validation of the binary interactions between every vertex pair. It is usually more practical to infer the network from surrogate observations. Network inference is the process by which an underlying network of relations between entities is determined from indirect evidence. While many algorithms have been developed to infer networks from quantitative data, less attention has been paid to methods which infer networks from repeated co-occurrence of entities in related sets. This type of data is ubiquitous in the field of systems biology and in other areas of complex systems research. Hence, such methods would be of great utility and value. RESULTS: Here we present a general method for network inference from repeated observations of sets of related entities. Given experimental observations of such sets, we infer the underlying network connecting these entities by generating an ensemble of networks consistent with the data. The frequency of occurrence of a given link throughout this ensemble is interpreted as the probability that the link is present in the underlying real network conditioned on the data. Exponential random graphs are used to generate and sample the ensemble of consistent networks, and we take an algorithmic approach to numerically execute the inference method. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on synthetic data before employing this inference approach to problems in systems biology and systems pharmacology, as well as to construct a co-authorship collaboration network. We predict direct protein-protein interactions from high-throughput mass-spectrometry proteomics, integrate data from Chip-seq and loss-of-function/gain-of-function followed by expression data to infer a network of associations between pluripotency regulators, extract a network that connects 53 cancer drugs to each other and to 34 severe adverse events by mining the FDA's Adverse Events Reporting Systems (AERS), and construct a co-authorship network that connects Mount Sinai School of Medicine investigators. The predicted networks and online software to create networks from entity-set libraries are provided online at http://www.maayanlab.net/S2N.

"The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a critical regulator of growth, survival, and energy metabolism. The allosteric TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has been used extensively to elucidate the TOR related signal pathway but is limited by its inability to inhibit TORC2. We used an unbiased cell proliferation assay of a kinase inhibitor library to discover QL-IX-55 as a potent inhibitor of S. cerevisiae growth. The functional target of QL-IX-55 is the ATP-binding site of TOR2 as evidenced by the discovery of resistant alleles of TOR2 through rational design and unbiased selection strategies. QL-IX-55 is capable of potently inhibiting both TOR complex 1 and 2 (TORC1 and TORC2) as demonstrated by biochemical IP kinase assays (IC(50) <50 nM) and cellular assays for inhibition of substrate YPK1 phosphorylation.

"Genetic approaches have shown that the p110β isoform of class Ia phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is essential for the growth of PTEN-null tumors. Thus, it is desirable to develop p110β-specific inhibitors for cancer therapy. Using a panel of PI3K isoform-specific cellular assays, we screened a collection of compounds possessing activities against kinases in the PI3K superfamily and identified a potent and selective p110β inhibitor: KIN-193. We show that KIN-193 is efficacious specifically in blocking AKT signaling and tumor growth that are dependent on p110β activation or PTEN loss. Broad profiling across a panel of 422 human tumor cell lines shows that the PTEN mutation status of cancer cells strongly correlates with their response to KIN-193. Together, our data provide the first pharmacologic evidence that PTEN-deficient tumors are dependent on p110β in animals and suggest that KIN-193 can be pursued as a drug to treat tumors that are dependent on p110β while sparing other PI3K isoforms.",0.0,Functional characterization of an isoform-selective inhibitor of PI3K-p110β as a potential anticancer agent.,0.0,"Ni J, Liu Q, Xie S, Carlson C, Von T, Vogel K, Riddle S, Benes C, Eck M, Roberts T, Gray N, Zhao J",,1.0,,6/22/16 0:00,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0003,5,Cancer Discovery,,22588880.0,PMC3384541,425-33,68.0,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,,2,2012.0,PMC3384541,"['3799284', '3606591', '5808977', '5528799', '5502826', '4384662', '4333106', '5406709', '5356644', '4820873', '4896088', '4598950', '5558511', '5581093', '5726441', '5460504', '5050018', '5548615', '4648175', '4035990', '4503252', '4059381', '4007928', '6010350', '4178865', '5704918', '4025772', '4630555', '3811159', '4003165', '5800427', '4409143', '3700760', '5963793', '5193024', '4955574', '5449270', '5591764', '4827870', '3731546', '4310752', '3552942', '5354802', '5892720', '4485402', '4293347', '5396071', '3979326', '4745884', '3787523', '4429698', '4219313', '3903710', '3431500', '5249192', '5029543', '4320669', '4951255']",58.0,"[2013, 2013, 2017, 2015, 2017, 0, 2014, 2017, 2016, 2016, 0, 2015, 2016, 2017, 0, 2017, 2016, 2017, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2014, 0, 2016, 0, 0, 2012, 0, 0, 2013, 2017, 2014, 2013, 2017, 2016, 0, 2016, 2017, 2015, 0, 0, 2012, 2016, 2017, 0, 2014, 2015, 2012, 2014, 0, 2014, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2017, 2016, 2014, 2016]",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"An intensive recent effort to develop ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors has resulted in several potent and selective molecules such as Torin1, PP242, KU63794, and WYE354. These inhibitors are being widely used as pharmacological probes of mTOR-dependent biology. To determine the potency and specificity of these agents, we have undertaken a systematic kinome-wide effort to profile their selectivity and potency using chemical proteomics and assays for enzymatic activity, protein binding, and disruption of cellular signaling. Enzymatic and cellular assays revealed that all four compounds are potent inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2, with Torin1 exhibiting ∼20-fold greater potency for inhibition of Thr-389 phosphorylation on S6 kinases (EC(50) = 2 nM) relative to other inhibitors. In vitro biochemical profiling at 10 μM revealed binding of PP242 to numerous kinases, although WYE354 and KU63794 bound only to p38 kinases and PI3K isoforms and Torin1 to ataxia telangiectasia mutated, ATM and Rad3-related protein, and DNA-PK. Analysis of these protein targets in cellular assays did not reveal any off-target activities for Torin1, WYE354, and KU63794 at concentrations below 1 μM but did show that PP242 efficiently inhibited the RET receptor (EC(50), 42 nM) and JAK1/2/3 kinases (EC(50), 780 nM). In addition, Torin1 displayed unusually slow kinetics for inhibition of the mTORC1/2 complex, a property likely to contribute to the pharmacology of this inhibitor. Our results demonstrated that, with the exception of PP242, available ATP-competitive compounds are highly selective mTOR inhibitors when applied to cells at concentrations below 1 μM and that the compounds may represent a starting point for medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at developing inhibitors of other PI3K kinase-related kinases.",0.0,Kinome-wide selectivity profiling of ATP-competitive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and characterization of their binding kinetics.,0.0,"Liu Q, Kirubakaran S, Hur W, Niepel M, Westover K, Thoreen CC, Wang J, Ni J, Patricelli MP, Vogel K, Riddle S, Waller DL, Traynor R, Sanda T, Zhao Z, Kang SA, Zhao J, Look AT, Sorger PK, Sabatini DM, Gray NS",,1.0,,6/22/16 0:00,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1074/jbc.M111.304485,287,Journal of Biological Chemistry,,22223645.0,PMC3322972,9742-52,70.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,13,2012.0,PMC3322972,"['3438685', '4612364', '4586745', '4146409', '3528803', '4270195', '3583020', '5347562', '3551765', '4140196', '3664950', '4801004', '5096457', '3808319', '4983736', '5766080', '3769325', '3527976', '3383597', '5813583', '5972226', '3760004', '3578870', '6053665', '4313067', '3842999', '5311240', '3782355', '4922265', '5033243', '3601842', '3779533', '5311965', '3912084', '4852795', '3953821', '5940374', '4565204', '5079084']",39.0,"[2012, 2015, 0, 2014, 2012, 2014, 0, 2017, 2013, 2013, 0, 0, 2016, 2013, 2016, 2018, 2013, 2012, 0, 2017, 2018, 2013, 2013, 2018, 2015, 0, 2017, 2012, 2016, 0, 2013, 2013, 2017, 2014, 0, 0, 2018, 2015, 2016]",0,0,0,1,1,0,0

"BACKGROUND: System-wide profiling of genes and proteins in mammalian cells produce lists of differentially expressed genes/proteins that need to be further analyzed for their collective functions in order to extract new knowledge. Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for improvement. RESULTS: Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios.

"High-throughput data sets such as genome-wide protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions and gene expression data have been published for several model systems, especially for human cancer samples. The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Interaction Browser (http://sysbio.soe.ucsc.edu/nets) is an online tool for biologists to view high-throughput data sets simultaneously for the analysis of functional relationships between biological entities. Users can access several public interaction networks and functional genomics data sets through the portal as well as upload their own networks and data sets for analysis. Users can navigate through correlative relationships for focused sets of genes belonging to biological pathways using a standard web browser. Using a new visual modality called the CircleMap, multiple 'omics' data sets can be viewed simultaneously within the context of curated, predicted, directed and undirected regulatory interactions. The Interaction Browser provides an integrative viewing of biological networks based on the consensus of many observations about genes and their products, which may provide new insights about normal and disease processes not obvious from any isolated data set.",0.0,The UCSC Interaction Browser: multidimensional data views in pathway context.,0.0,"Wong CK, Vaske CJ, Ng S, Sanborn JZ, Benz SC, Haussler D, Stuart JM",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1093/nar/gkt473,Web Server issue,Nucleic Acids Research,,23748957.0,PMC3692096,W218-24,21.0,"{\UCSC Interaction Browser\"":\""http://sysbio.soe.ucsc.edu/nets\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,1.0,5/19/16 18:33,41,2013.0,PMC3692096,"['3880012', '5386720', '5665485', '5093089', '4385735', '4198916', '4804509', '4410657', '4339225']",9.0,"[2013, 2017, 0, 2016, 2014, 2014, 2016, 2014, 2015]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Identifying transcription factors (TF) involved in producing a genome-wide transcriptional profile is an essential step in building mechanistic model that can explain observed gene expression data. We developed a statistical framework for constructing genome-wide signatures of TF activity, and for using such signatures in the analysis of gene expression data produced by complex transcriptional regulatory programs. Our framework integrates ChIP-seq data and appropriately matched gene expression profiles to identify True REGulatory (TREG) TF-gene interactions. It provides genome-wide quantification of the likelihood of regulatory TF-gene interaction that can be used to either identify regulated genes, or as genome-wide signature of TF activity. To effectively use ChIP-seq data, we introduce a novel statistical model that integrates information from all binding \peaks\"" within 2 Mb window around a gene's transcription start site (TSS), and provides gene-level binding scores and probabilities of regulatory interaction. In the second step we integrate these binding scores and regulatory probabilities with gene expression data to assess the likelihood of True REGulatory (TREG) TF-gene interactions. We demonstrate the advantages of TREG framework in identifying genes regulated by two TFs with widely different distribution of functional binding events (ERα and E2f1). We also show that TREG signatures of TF activity vastly improve our ability to detect involvement of ERα in producing complex diseases-related transcriptional profiles. Through a large study of disease-related transcriptional signatures and transcriptional signatures of drug activity, we demonstrate that increase in statistical power associated with the use of TREG signatures makes the crucial difference in identifying key targets for treatment, and drugs to use for treatment. All methods are implemented in an open-source R package treg. The package also contains all data used in the analysis including 494 TREG binding profiles based on ENCODE ChIP-seq data.

"Genome-wide expression data from tumors and cell lines in breast cancer, together with drug response of cell lines, open prospects for integrative analyses that can lead to better personalized therapy. Drug responses and expression data collected from cell lines and tumors were used to generate tripartite networks connecting clusters of patients to cell lines and cell lines to drugs, to connect drugs to patients. Various approaches were applied to connect cell lines to tumor clusters: a standard method that uses a biomarker gene set, and new methods that compute metasignatures for transcription factors and histone modifications given upregulated genes in cell lines or tumors. The results from the metasignature analysis identify two major clusters of patients: one enriched for active histone marks and one for repressive marks. The tumors enriched for activation marks are correlated with poor prognosis. Overall, the analyses suggest new patient clustering, discover dysregulated pathways, and recommend individualized use of drugs to treat subsets of patients.CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology (2013) 2, e35; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.11; advance online publication 27 March 2013.",1.0,Metasignatures identify two major subtypes of breast cancer.,0.0,"Ma'ayan A, Kou Y, Duan Q, Clark NR, Gordonov S",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1038/psp.2013.11,,CPT: Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology,,23836026.0,PMC3615534,e35,24.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,2,2013.0,PMC3615534,"['4153537', '4925810', '5411077', '4675694', '3712222', '4868673', '3789539', '4221125', '4965635']",9.0,"[2014, 2016, 2017, 0, 2013, 2016, 2013, 2014, 2016]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"mTOR is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that serves as a central regulator of cell growth, survival, and autophagy. Deregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway occurs commonly in cancer and numerous inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding site of these kinases are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Here, we report the characterization of Torin2, a second-generation ATP-competitive inhibitor that is potent and selective for mTOR with a superior pharmacokinetic profile to previous inhibitors. Torin2 inhibited mTORC1-dependent T389 phosphorylation on S6K (RPS6KB1) with an EC(50) of 250 pmol/L with approximately 800-fold selectivity for cellular mTOR versus phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Torin2 also exhibited potent biochemical and cellular activity against phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-like kinase (PIKK) family kinases including ATM (EC(50), 28 nmol/L), ATR (EC(50), 35 nmol/L), and DNA-PK (EC(50), 118 nmol/L; PRKDC), the inhibition of which sensitized cells to Irradiation. Similar to the earlier generation compound Torin1 and in contrast to other reported mTOR inhibitors, Torin2 inhibited mTOR kinase and mTORC1 signaling activities in a sustained manner suggestive of a slow dissociation from the kinase. Cancer cell treatment with Torin2 for 24 hours resulted in a prolonged block in negative feedback and consequent T308 phosphorylation on Akt. These effects were associated with strong growth inhibition in vitro. Single-agent treatment with Torin2 in vivo did not yield significant efficacy against KRAS-driven lung tumors, but the combination of Torin2 with mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor AZD6244 yielded a significant growth inhibition. Taken together, our findings establish Torin2 as a strong candidate for clinical evaluation in a broad number of oncologic settings where mTOR signaling has a pathogenic role.",0.0,"Characterization of Torin2, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTOR, ATM, and ATR.",0.0,"Niepel M, Gray NS, Liu Q, Xu C, Kirubakaran S, Zhang X, Hur W, Liu Y, Kwiatkowski NP, Wang J, Westover KD, Gao P, Ercan D, Thoreen CC, Kang SA, Patricelli MP, Wang Y, Tupper T, Altabef A, Kawamura H, Held KD, Chou DM, Elledge SJ, Janne PA, Wong KK, Sabatini DM",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1702,8,Cancer Research,,23436801.0,PMC3760004,2574-86,25.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,73,2013.0,PMC3760004,"['5675614', '4259403', '4128044', '4502728', '5346993', '5395116', '5342446', '4693276', '5315031', '4831814', '5796869', '3827918', '4607622', '3894558', '4824006', '4667710', '4924753', '5007757', '4627234', '4237307', '4313067', '3725503', '5341177', '5029691', '5533897', '3864542', '4922265', '6072143', '4437987', '3903232', '3779533', '3912084', '3953821', '6075515', '5079084']",35.0,"[2017, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2017, 0, 2016, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2017, 2013, 2015, 2014, 2015, 2014, 2016, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2015, 2013, 2017, 2016, 2017, 2013, 2016, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2014, 0, 2016, 2016]",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Large-scale analysis of cellular response to anticancer drugs typically focuses on variation in potency (half-maximum inhibitory concentration, (IC50)), assuming that it is the most important difference between effective and ineffective drugs or sensitive and resistant cells. We took a multiparametric approach involving analysis of the slope of the dose-response curve, the area under the curve and the maximum effect (Emax). We found that some of these parameters vary systematically with cell line and others with drug class. For cell-cycle inhibitors, Emax often but not always correlated with cell proliferation rate. For drugs targeting the Akt/PI3K/mTOR pathway, dose-response curves were unusually shallow. Classical pharmacology has no ready explanation for this phenomenon, but single-cell analysis showed that it correlated with significant and heritable cell-to-cell variability in the extent of target inhibition.

"Malignant melanomas harbouring point mutations (Val600Glu) in the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) depend on RAF-MEK-ERK signalling for tumour cell growth. RAF and MEK inhibitors show remarkable clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) melanoma; however, resistance to these agents remains a formidable challenge. Global characterization of resistance mechanisms may inform the development of more effective therapeutic combinations. Here we carried out systematic gain-of-function resistance studies by expressing more than 15,500 genes individually in a BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell line treated with RAF, MEK, ERK or combined RAF-MEK inhibitors. These studies revealed a cyclic-AMP-dependent melanocytic signalling network not previously associated with drug resistance, including G-protein-coupled receptors, adenyl cyclase, protein kinase A and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Preliminary analysis of biopsies from BRAF(V600E) melanoma patients revealed that phosphorylated (active) CREB was suppressed by RAF-MEK inhibition but restored in relapsing tumours. Expression of transcription factors activated downstream of MAP kinase and cAMP pathways also conferred resistance, including c-FOS, NR4A1, NR4A2 and MITF. Combined treatment with MAPK-pathway and histone-deacetylase inhibitors suppressed MITF expression and cAMP-mediated resistance. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic dysregulation of a melanocyte lineage dependency can cause resistance to RAF-MEK-ERK inhibition, which may be overcome by combining signalling- and chromatin-directed therapeutics.",0.0,A melanocyte lineage program confers resistance to MAP kinase pathway inhibition.,0.0,"Johannessen CM, Johnson LA, Piccioni F, Townes A, Frederick DT, Donahue MK, Narayan R, Flaherty KT, Wargo JA, Root DE, Garraway LA",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1038/nature12688,7478,Nature,,24185007.0,PMC4098832,138-42,27.0,"{\KS Query\"":null,\""GSEA\"":null}""",0.0,,,0.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,504,2013.0,PMC4098832,"['4363485', '4659938', '3964064', '5701046', '4717845', '4398996', '5112703', '5059112', '4147301', '5124530', '5305212', '4154497', '5313047', '5876130', '4908108', '5957297', '6076867', '5342406', '5003022', '4420636', '5435346', '5079679', '4281276', '5119958', '4594182', '4294377', '4559199', '4288358', '4279367', '4031441', '4408261', '5873878', '6095730', '4823922', '4355234', '4190567', '5528621', '5371854', '4609261', '5048365', '4695870', '5528620', '5650456', '4905366', '5167176', '4891023', '4831844', '4167745', '5653508', '5297047', '4583389', '5883534', '4689159', '5193106', '4507807', '4099524', '4701046', '5248573', '5706657', '4604168', '5743623', '4101763', '5342073', '4944528', '4169564', '4163536', '4412490', '5528618', '4826182', '4325379', '4694844', '5120861', '5819998', '5435887', '4123291', '5746373', '5815936', '5799768', '4432663', '4039128', '4179759', '5708181', '4622697', '4821508', '5346251', '4970460', '4785103', '5754352', '5085243', '4373107', '6024333', '4796027', '4289115', '4184867', '5421939', '5087317', '6053443', '5287109', '4692100', '5862306', '4336945', '4428333', '5909674', '4330752', '5891348', '5012007', '5658758', '6021419', '5528501', '4737758', '4466007', '4250230', '5378933', '4643408', '5016172', '6065179', '4150215', '5722575', '4040458', '3947296', '5050154', '5696266', '4435825']",123.0,"[2014, 2015, 2014, 2017, 2015, 0, 2016, 0, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2014, 0, 2018, 2016, 0, 2018, 2016, 2016, 2014, 2017, 2016, 2014, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2015, 2014, 2014, 0, 2015, 2018, 2018, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2014, 2017, 2015, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2017, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2014, 0, 2017, 2015, 2018, 2015, 2016, 2015, 0, 0, 2017, 2017, 2015, 2017, 2014, 2016, 0, 2014, 2014, 2015, 2014, 2015, 0, 2015, 0, 2017, 0, 2014, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2015, 2014, 2014, 2017, 2015, 0, 2017, 2015, 2015, 2018, 2016, 2015, 2018, 0, 2014, 0, 2017, 2016, 2018, 0, 2015, 2017, 2014, 2014, 2018, 2015, 2017, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2013, 2016, 2015, 0, 2016, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2014, 2017, 0, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2015]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secreted proteins dictate a range of cellular functions in human health and disease. Because of the high degree of cellular heterogeneity and, more importantly, polyfunctionality of individual cells, there is an unmet need to simultaneously measure an array of proteins from single cells and to rapidly assay a large number of single cells (more than 1000) in parallel. We describe a simple bioanalytical assay platform consisting of a large array of subnanoliter microchambers integrated with high-density antibody barcode microarrays for highly multiplexed protein detection from over a thousand single cells in parallel. This platform has been tested for both cell lines and complex biological samples such as primary cells from patients. We observed distinct heterogeneity among the single cell secretomic signatures that, for the first time, can be directly correlated to the cells' physical behavior such as migration.

"Identifying factors responsible for variation in drug response is essential for the effective use of targeted therapeutics. We profiled signaling pathway activity in a collection of breast cancer cell lines before and after stimulation with physiologically relevant ligands, which revealed the variability in network activity among cells of known genotype and molecular subtype. Despite the receptor-based classification of breast cancer subtypes, we found that the abundance and activity of signaling proteins in unstimulated cells (basal profile), as well as the activity of proteins in stimulated cells (signaling profile), varied within each subtype. Using a partial least-squares regression approach, we constructed models that significantly predicted sensitivity to 23 targeted therapeutics. For example, one model showed that the response to the growth factor receptor ligand heregulin effectively predicted the sensitivity of cells to drugs targeting the cell survival pathway mediated by PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and Akt, whereas the abundance of Akt or the mutational status of the enzymes in the pathway did not.

"MOTIVATION: Identifying the cellular wiring that connects genomic perturbations to transcriptional changes in cancer is essential to gain a mechanistic understanding of disease initiation, progression and ultimately to predict drug response. We have developed a method called Tied Diffusion Through Interacting Events (TieDIE) that uses a network diffusion approach to connect genomic perturbations to gene expression changes characteristic of cancer subtypes.

"The ribosome is centrally situated to sense metabolic states, but whether its activity, in turn, coherently rewires transcriptional responses is unknown. Here, through integrated chemical-genetic analyses, we found that a dominant transcriptional effect of blocking protein translation in cancer cells was inactivation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a multifaceted transcriptional regulator of the heat-shock response and many other cellular processes essential for anabolic metabolism, cellular proliferation, and tumorigenesis. These analyses linked translational flux to the regulation of HSF1 transcriptional activity and to the modulation of energy metabolism.

"Large corpora of kinase small molecule inhibitor data are accessible to public sector research from thousands of journal article and patent publications. These data have been generated employing a wide variety of assay methodologies and experimental procedures by numerous laboratories. Here we ask the question how applicable these heterogeneous data sets are to predict kinase activities and which characteristics of the data sets contribute to their utility. We accessed almost 500,000 molecules from the Kinase Knowledge Base (KKB) and after rigorous aggregation and standardization generated over 180 distinct data sets covering all major groups of the human kinome. To assess the value of the data sets, we generated hundreds of classification and regression models. Their rigorous cross-validation and characterization demonstrated highly predictive classification and quantitative models for the majority of kinase targets if a minimum required number of active compounds or structure-activity data points were available. We then applied the best classifiers to compounds most recently profiled in the NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program and found good agreement of profiling results with predicted activities.

"Substantial effort in recent years has been devoted to analyzing data based large-scale biological networks, which provide valuable insight into the topologies of complex biological networks but are rarely context specific and cannot be used to predict the responses of cell signaling proteins to specific ligands or compounds. In this work, we proposed a novel strategy to investigate kinase inhibitor induced pathway signatures by integrating multiplex data in Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), e.g. KINOMEscan data and cell proliferation/mitosis imaging data. Using this strategy, we first established a PC9 cell line specific pathway model to investigate the pathway signatures in PC9 cell line when perturbed by a small molecule kinase inhibitor GW843682. This specific pathway revealed the role of PI3K/AKT in modulating the cell proliferation process and the absence of two anti-proliferation links, which indicated a potential mechanism of abnormal expansion in PC9 cell number. Incorporating the pathway model for side effects on primary human hepatocytes, it was used to screen 27 kinase inhibitors in LINCS database and PF02341066, known as Crizotinib, was finally suggested with an optimal concentration 4.6 uM to suppress PC9 cancer cell expansion while avoiding severe damage to primary human hepatocytes. Drug combination analysis revealed that the synergistic effect region can be predicted straightforwardly based on a threshold which is an inherent property of each kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, this integration strategy can be easily extended to other specific cell lines to be a powerful tool for drug screen before clinical trials.",0.0,Systematically studying kinase inhibitor induced signaling network signature by integrating both therapeutic and side effects.,0.0,"Zhou X, Shao H, Peng T, Ji Z, Su J",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0080832,12,PLoS One,,24339888.0,PMC3855094,e80832,33.0,"{\KIEP\"":\""http://ctsb.is.wfubmc.edu/itNETZ/KIEP.html\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,8,2013.0,PMC3855094,"['4751505', '5763468', '4370756', '4619778', '5366773', '4983505', '5005272', '4179751', '5737394']",9.0,"[2016, 2017, 2015, 2015, 2017, 2016, 2016, 2014, 2017]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"MOTIVATION: Networks are vital to computational systems biology research, but visualizing them is a challenge. For networks larger than ∼100 nodes and ∼200 links, ball-and-stick diagrams fail to convey much information. To address this, we developed Network2Canvas (N2C), a web application that provides an alternative way to view networks. N2C visualizes networks by placing nodes on a square toroidal canvas. The network nodes are clustered on the canvas using simulated annealing to maximize local connections where a node's brightness is made proportional to its local fitness. The interactive canvas is implemented in HyperText Markup Language (HTML)5 with the JavaScript library Data-Driven Documents (D3). We applied N2C to visualize 30 canvases made from human and mouse gene-set libraries and 6 canvases made from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug-set libraries. Given lists of genes or drugs, enriched terms are highlighted on the canvases, and their degree of clustering is computed. Because N2C produces visual patterns of enriched terms on canvases, a trained eye can detect signatures instantly. In summary, N2C provides a new flexible method to visualize large networks and can be used to perform and visualize gene-set and drug-set enrichment analyses.",1.0,Network2Canvas: Network visualization on a canvas with enrichment analysis.,0.0,"Ma'ayan A, Tan CM, Clark NR, Chen EY, Dannenfelser R",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,15,Bioinformatics,,23749960.0,PMC3712222,1872-8,34.0,"{\Network2Canvas\"":\""http://www.maayanlab.net/N2C\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,1.0,5/19/16 18:33,29,2013.0,PMC3712222,"['4153537', '5992522', '5581088', '4086107', '5399661', '5324308', '5088783', '4675694', '5577301', '4345400', '6029396', '4086130', '4221125', '4402723', '4065073', '3842763', '4706788', '5587027', '5374737']",19.0,"[2014, 2018, 2017, 2014, 0, 2017, 2016, 0, 2017, 0, 2018, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2017]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Wnt signaling plays a critical role in embryonic development, and genetic aberrations in this network have been broadly implicated in colorectal cancer. We find that the Wnt receptor Frizzled2 (Fzd2) and its ligands Wnt5a/b are elevated in metastatic liver, lung, colon, and breast cancer cell lines and in high-grade tumors and that their expression correlates with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Pharmacologic and genetic perturbations reveal that Fzd2 drives EMT and cell migration through a previously unrecognized, noncanonical pathway that includes Fyn and Stat3.

"Reconstructing regulatory and signaling response networks is one of the major goals of systems biology. While several successful methods have been suggested for this task, some integrating large and diverse datasets, these methods have so far been applied to reconstruct a single response network at a time, even when studying and modeling related conditions. To improve network reconstruction we developed MT-SDREM, a multi-task learning method which jointly models networks for several related conditions. In MT-SDREM, parameters are jointly constrained across the networks while still allowing for condition-specific pathways and regulation. We formulate the multi-task learning problem and discuss methods for optimizing the joint target function. We applied MT-SDREM to reconstruct dynamic human response networks for three flu strains: H1N1, H5N1 and H3N2. Our multi-task learning method was able to identify known and novel factors and genes, improving upon prior methods that model each condition independently. The MT-SDREM networks were also better at identifying proteins whose removal affects viral load indicating that joint learning can still lead to accurate, condition-specific, networks.

LINCS data include genome-wide transcriptional signatures, biochemical protein binding profiles, cellular phenotypic response profiles and various other datasets for a wide range of cell model systems and molecular and genetic perturbations. Here we present a partial survey of this data facilitated by data standards and in particular a robust compound standardization workflow; we integrated several types of LINCS signatures and analyzed the results with a focus on mechanism of action (MoA) and chemical compounds. We illustrate how kinase targets can be related to disease models and relevant drugs. We identified some fundamental trends that appear to link Kinome binding profiles and transcriptional signatures to chemical information and biochemical binding profiles to transcriptional responses independent of chemical similarity. To fill gaps in the datasets we developed and applied predictive models. The results can be interpreted at the systems level as demonstrated based on a large number of signaling pathways. We can identify clear global relationships, suggesting robustness of cellular responses to chemical perturbation. Overall, the results suggest that chemical similarity is a useful measure at the systems level, which would support phenotypic drug optimization efforts.

"Bioinformatics and computer aided drug design rely on the curation of a large number of protocols for biological assays that measure the ability of potential drugs to achieve a therapeutic effect. These assay protocols are generally published by scientists in the form of plain text, which needs to be more precisely annotated in order to be useful to software methods. We have developed a pragmatic approach to describing assays according to the semantic definitions of the BioAssay Ontology (BAO) project, using a hybrid of machine learning based on natural language processing, and a simplified user interface designed to help scientists curate their data with minimum effort. We have carried out this work based on the premise that pure machine learning is insufficiently accurate, and that expecting scientists to find the time to annotate their protocols manually is unrealistic. By combining these approaches, we have created an effective prototype for which annotation of bioassay text within the domain of the training set can be accomplished very quickly. Well-trained annotations require single-click user approval, while annotations from outside the training set domain can be identified using the search feature of a well-designed user interface, and subsequently used to improve the underlying models. By drastically reducing the time required for scientists to annotate their assays, we can realistically advocate for semantic annotation to become a standard part of the publication process.

The main objectives of BAO are to enable effective integration, aggregation, retrieval, and analyses of drug screening data. Since we first released BAO on the BioPortal in 2010 we have considerably expanded and enhanced BAO and we have applied the ontology in several internal and external collaborative projects, for example the BioAssay Research Database (BARD). We describe the evolution of BAO with a design that enables modeling complex assays including profile and panel assays such as those in the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). One of the critical questions in evolving BAO is the following: how can we provide a way to efficiently reuse and share among various research projects specific parts of our ontologies without violating the integrity of the ontology and without creating redundancies. This paper provides a comprehensive answer to this question with a description of a methodology for ontology modularization using a layered architecture. Our modularization approach defines several distinct BAO components and separates internal from external modules and domain-level from structural components. This approach facilitates the generation/extraction of derived ontologies (or perspectives) that can suit particular use cases or software applications. We describe the evolution of BAO related to its formal structures, engineering approaches, and content to enable modeling of complex assays and integration with other ontologies and datasets.",0.0,"Evolving BioAssay Ontology (BAO): modularization, integration and applications.",0.0,"Koleti A, Schürer SC, Visser U, Abeyruwan S, Vempati UD, Küçük-McGinty H, Mir A, Sakurai K, Chung C, Bittker JA, Clemons PA, Brudz S, Siripala A, Morales AJ, Romacker M, Twomey D, Bureeva S, Lemmon V",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.1186/2041-1480-5-S1-S5,Suppl 1 Proceedings of the Bio-Ontologies Spec Interest G,Journal of Biomedical Semantics,,25093074.0,PMC4108877,S5,15.0,"{\LIFE\"":\""http://life.ccs.miami.edu/life/\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,5,2014.0,PMC4108877,"['6007090', '4137659', '4607714', '5679337', '5129546', '5814751', '4823819', '4108850', '5487293', '4578352', '4652617', '5622518', '4943296', '4510462', '6004408', '5753343', '4556094', '5210557', '5683383', '5763302', '5753190', '5978404', '5765662']",23.0,"[2018, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2016, 0, 2016, 2014, 2017, 2015, 2015, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2018, 2017, 0, 2016, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2018, 2018]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"BACKGROUND: Soluble growth factors present in the microenvironment play a major role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis, and responsiveness to targeted therapies. While the biochemistry of growth factor-dependent signal transduction has been studied extensively in individual cell types, relatively little systematic data are available across genetically diverse cell lines. RESULTS: We describe a quantitative and comparative dataset focused on immediate-early signaling that regulates the AKT (AKT1/2/3) and ERK (MAPK1/3) pathways in a canonical panel of well-characterized breast cancer lines. We also provide interactive web-based tools to facilitate follow-on analysis of the data. Our findings show that breast cancers are diverse with respect to ligand sensitivity and signaling biochemistry. Surprisingly, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs; which express low levels of ErbB2, progesterone and estrogen receptors) are the most broadly responsive to growth factors and HER2amp cancers (which overexpress ErbB2) the least. The ratio of ERK to AKT activation varies with ligand and subtype, with a systematic bias in favor of ERK in hormone receptor positive (HR+) cells. The factors that correlate with growth factor responsiveness depend on whether fold-change or absolute activity is considered the key biological variable, and they differ between ERK and AKT pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Responses to growth factors are highly diverse across breast cancer cell lines, even within the same subtype. A simple four-part heuristic suggests that diversity arises from variation in receptor abundance, an ERK/AKT bias that depends on ligand identity, a set of factors common to all receptors that varies in abundance or activity with cell line, and an \indirect negative regulation\"" by ErbB2. This analysis sets the stage for the development of a mechanistic and predictive model of growth factor signaling in diverse cancer lines.

"The National Institutes of Health Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program is generating extensive multidimensional data sets, including biochemical, genome-wide transcriptional, and phenotypic cellular response signatures to a variety of small-molecule and genetic perturbations with the goal of creating a sustainable, widely applicable, and readily accessible systems biology knowledge resource. Integration and analysis of diverse LINCS data sets depend on the availability of sufficient metadata to describe the assays and screening results and on their syntactic, structural, and semantic consistency. Here we report metadata specifications for the most important molecular and cellular components and recommend them for adoption beyond the LINCS project. We focus on the minimum required information to model LINCS assays and results based on a number of use cases, and we recommend controlled terminologies and ontologies to annotate assays with syntactic consistency and semantic integrity. We also report specifications for a simple annotation format (SAF) to describe assays and screening results based on our metadata specifications with explicit controlled vocabularies. SAF specifically serves to programmatically access and exchange LINCS data as a prerequisite for a distributed information management infrastructure. We applied the metadata specifications to annotate large numbers of LINCS cell lines, proteins, and small molecules.

"High-content screening (HCS; fluorescence microscopy with multiple markers followed by automated image analysis) is gaining popularity in drug discovery due to the rich information it reveals about drug responses. It is particularly useful in studying anti-mitotic drug responses since mitotic arrest provides an activity biomarker. One conventional way to probe mitotic arrest and downstream apoptosis response is to use mitosis- and apoptosis-specific antibodies in cell-based imaging assays. However, weakly attached cells, especially dead cells, are mostly washed out during antibody labeling steps. Here, we report a rapid and convenient one-step cell-imaging assay that accurately measures cell-cycle state and apoptosis in mammalian cells. The assay uses three fluorescent dyes to stain living cells, involves no wash, and is fixable after live-cell labeling. Compared to the antibody-based method, this assay is quicker, more cost-effective, and yields more accurate dose-response results.",0.0,A one-step imaging assay to monitor cell cycle state and apoptosis in mammalian cells.,1.0,Tang Y,,1.0,,6/22/16 0:00,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.1002/9780470559277.ch130140,1,Current Protocols in Chemical Biology,,24652619.0,PMC4016950,5-Jan,65.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,6,2014.0,PMC4016950,[],0.0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"BACKGROUND: Thousands of biological and biomedical investigators study of the functional role of single genes and their protein products in normal physiology and in disease. The findings from these studies are reported in research articles that stimulate new research. It is now established that a complex regulatory networks's is controlling human cellular fate, and this community of researchers are continually unraveling this network topology. Attempts to integrate results from such accumulated knowledge resulted in literature-based protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) and pathway databases. These databases are widely used by the community to analyze new data collected from emerging genome-wide studies with the assumption that the data within these literature-based databases is the ground truth and contain no biases. While suspicion for research focus biases is growing, a concrete proof for it is still missing. It is difficult to prove because the real PPINs are mostly unknown. RESULTS: Here we analyzed the longitudinal discovery process of literature-based mammalian and yeast PPINs to observe that these networks are discovered non-uniformly. The pattern of discovery is related to a theoretical concept proposed by Kauffman called \expanding the adjacent possible\"". We introduce a network discovery model which explicitly includes the space of possibilities in the form of a true underlying PPIN. CONCLUSIONS: Our model strongly suggests that research focus biases exist in the observed discovery dynamics of these networks. In summary, more care should be placed when using PPIN databases for analysis of newly acquired data, and when considering prior knowledge when designing new experiments.""",1.0,Dynamics of the discovery process of protein-protein interactions from low content studies.,0.0,"Wang Z, Ma'ayan A, Clark NC",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1186/s12918-015-0173-z,1,BMC Systems Biology,,26048415.0,PMC4456804,26,1.0,"{\Custom code\"":null}""",0.0,,,0.0,1.0,5/19/16 18:33,9,2015.0,PMC4456804,"['5389891', '4930834', '4704491', '5052684', '5636275', '6030863']",6.0,"[2016, 2016, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Drugs that inhibit RAF/MEK signaling, such as vemurafenib, elicit profound but often temporary anti-tumor responses in patients with BRAF(V) (600E) melanoma. Adaptive responses to RAF/MEK inhibition occur on a timescale of hours to days, involve homeostatic responses that reactivate MAP kinase signaling and compensatory mitogenic pathways, and attenuate the anti-tumor effects of RAF/MEK inhibitors. We profile adaptive responses across a panel of melanoma cell lines using multiplex biochemical measurement, single-cell assays, and statistical modeling and show that adaptation involves at least six signaling cascades that act to reduce drug potency (IC50) and maximal effect (i.e., Emax ≪ 1). Among these cascades, we identify a role for JNK/c-Jun signaling in vemurafenib adaptation and show that RAF and JNK inhibitors synergize in cell killing. This arises because JNK inhibition prevents a subset of cells in a cycling population from becoming quiescent upon vemurafenib treatment, thereby reducing drug Emax. Our findings demonstrate the breadth and diversity of adaptive responses to RAF/MEK inhibition and a means to identify which steps in a signaling cascade are most predictive of phenotypic response.",0.0,Systematic analysis of BRAFV600E melanomas reveals a role for JNK/c-Jun pathway in adaptive resistance to drug-induced apoptosis.,0.0,"Fallahi-Sichani M, Moerke NJ, Niepel M, Zhang T, Gray NS, Sorger PK",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.15252/msb.20145877,3,Molecular Systems Biology,,25814555.0,PMC4380931,797,3.0,"{\Publication Summary\"":\""http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/fallahi-sichani-molsystbiol-2015/\"", \""Project Explorer\"":\""http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/explore/adaptive-drug-resistance/\""}""",0.0,,,1.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,11,2015.0,PMC4380931,"['5012007', '5417482', '5087317', '5739608', '5662764', '5541718', '5978689', '5558834', '4991434', '4823068', '5725273', '4587398', '5248573', '4909414', '5429592', '5026573', '5537611', '4652136']",18.0,"[2016, 2017, 2016, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 0, 2015, 2017, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2017, 2015]",0,0,0,1,1,0,0

"MOTIVATION: Identification of differentially expressed genes is an important step in extracting knowledge from gene expression profiling studies. The raw expression data from microarray and other high-throughput technologies is deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and served as Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT) files. However, to extract and analyze differentially expressed genes from GEO requires significant computational skills. RESULTS: Here we introduce GEO2Enrichr, a browser extension for extracting differentially expressed gene sets from GEO and analyzing those sets with Enrichr, an independent gene set enrichment analysis tool containing over 70 000 annotated gene sets organized into 75 gene-set libraries. GEO2Enrichr adds JavaScript code to GEO web-pages; this code scrapes user selected accession numbers and metadata, and then, with one click, users can submit this information to a web-server application that downloads the SOFT files, parses, cleans and normalizes the data, identifies the differentially expressed genes, and then pipes the resulting gene lists to Enrichr for downstream functional analysis. GEO2Enrichr opens a new avenue for adding functionality to major bioinformatics resources such GEO by integrating tools and resources without the need for a plug-in architecture. Importantly, GEO2Enrichr helps researchers to quickly explore hypotheses with little technical overhead, lowering the barrier of entry for biologists by automating data processing steps needed for knowledge extraction from the major repository GEO.

"With advances in genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics, and more expansive electronic clinical record monitoring, as well as advances in computation, we have entered the Big Data era in biomedical research. Data gathering is growing rapidly while only a small fraction of this data is converted to useful knowledge or reused in future studies. To improve this, an important concept that is often overlooked is data abstraction. To fuse and reuse biomedical datasets from diverse resources, data abstraction is frequently required. Here we summarize some of the major Big Data biomedical research resources for genomics, proteomics and phenotype data, collected from mammalian cells, tissues and organisms. We then suggest simple data abstraction methods for fusing this diverse but related data.

"Single-cell analysis reveals aspects of cellular physiology not evident from population-based studies, particularly in the case of highly multiplexed methods such as mass cytometry (CyTOF) able to correlate the levels of multiple signalling, differentiation and cell fate markers. Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy adds information on cell morphology and the microenvironment that are not obtained using flow-based techniques, but the multiplicity of conventional IF is limited. This has motivated development of imaging methods that require specialized instrumentation, exotic reagents or proprietary protocols that are difficult to reproduce in most laboratories. Here we report a public-domain method for achieving high multiplicity single-cell IF using cyclic immunofluorescence (CycIF), a simple and versatile procedure in which four-colour staining alternates with chemical inactivation of fluorophores to progressively build a multichannel image.

"Gene set analysis of differential expression, which identifies collectively differentially expressed gene sets, has become an important tool for biology. The power of this approach lies in its reduction of the dimensionality of the statistical problem and its incorporation of biological interpretation by construction. Many approaches to gene set analysis have been proposed, but benchmarking their performance in the setting of real biological data is difficult due to the lack of a gold standard. In a previously published work we proposed a geometrical approach to differential expression which performed highly in benchmarking tests and compared well to the most popular methods of differential gene expression. As reported, this approach has a natural extension to gene set analysis which we call Principal Angle Enrichment Analysis (PAEA). PAEA employs dimensionality reduction and a multivariate approach for gene set enrichment analysis. However, the performance of this method has not been assessed nor its implementation as a web-based tool. Here we describe new benchmarking protocols for gene set analysis methods and find that PAEA performs highly. The PAEA method is implemented as a user-friendly web-based tool, which contains 70 gene set libraries and is freely available to the community.",1.0,Principal Angle Enrichment Analysis (PAEA): Dimensionally reduced multivariate gene set enrichment analysis tool.,0.0,"Wang Z, Monteiro CD, Jones MR, Clark NR, Ma’ayan A, Szymkiewicz M",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,Proceedings (IEEE Int Conf Bioinformatics Biomed),,26848405.0,PMC4737646,256-262,47.0,"{\Principal Angle Enrichment Analysis (PAEA)\"":\""http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/PAEA/\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,1.0,5/19/16 18:33,2015,2015.0,PMC4737646,"['5827688', '4987924', '5111283', '5438638', '5013261', '4965635']",6.0,"[2018, 2016, 2016, 2017, 2016, 2016]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Inhibition of cancer-promoting kinases is an established therapeutic strategy for the treatment of many cancers, although resistance to kinase inhibitors is common. One way to overcome resistance is to target orthogonal cancer-promoting pathways. Bromo and Extra-Terminal (BET) domain proteins, which belong to the family of epigenetic readers, have recently emerged as promising therapeutic targets in multiple cancers. The development of multitarget drugs that inhibit kinase and BET proteins therefore may be a promising strategy to overcome tumor resistance and prolong therapeutic efficacy in the clinic. We developed a general computational screening approach to identify novel dual kinase/bromodomain inhibitors from millions of commercially available small molecules. Our method integrated machine learning using big datasets of kinase inhibitors and structure-based drug design. Here we describe the computational methodology, including validation and characterization of our models and their application and integration into a scalable virtual screening pipeline. We screened over 6 million commercially available compounds and selected 24 for testing in BRD4 and EGFR biochemical assays. We identified several novel BRD4 inhibitors, among them a first in class dual EGFR-BRD4 inhibitor.

"When cells are exposed to death ligands such as TRAIL, a fraction undergoes apoptosis and a fraction survives; if surviving cells are re-exposed to TRAIL, fractional killing is once again observed. Therapeutic antibodies directed against TRAIL receptors also cause fractional killing, even at saturating concentrations, limiting their effectiveness. Fractional killing arises from cell-to-cell fluctuations in protein levels (extrinsic noise), but how this results in a clean bifurcation between life and death remains unclear. In this paper, we identify a threshold in the rate and timing of initiator caspase activation that distinguishes cells that live from those that die; by mapping this threshold, we can predict fractional killing of cells exposed to natural and synthetic agonists alone or in combination with sensitizing drugs such as bortezomib. A phenomenological model of the threshold also quantifies the contributions of two resistance genes (c-FLIP and Bcl-2), providing new insight into the control of cell fate by opposing pro-death and pro-survival proteins and suggesting new criteria for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic TRAIL receptor agonists.",0.0,Fractional killing arises from cell-to-cell variability in overcoming a caspase activity threshold.,0.0,"Sorger PK, Hafner M, Roux J, Bandara S, Sims JJ, Hudson H, Chai D",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.15252/msb.20145584,5,Molecular Systems Biology,,25953765.0,PMC4461398,803,56.0,"{\Publication Summary\"":\""http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/roux-molsystbiol-2015/\"", \""Project Explorer\"":\""http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/explore/trail-threshold-variability/\"", \""MATLAB Scripts\"":\""http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/explore/trail-threshold-variability/\""}""",0.0,,,1.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,11,2015.0,PMC4461398,"['5556027', '5278449', '5997492', '5991653', '5465904', '5608455', '6089072', '5876652', '6039425', '5630128', '5785974', '5341104', '5217463', '4738397', '5457394', '5509363', '4691174', '5879788']",18.0,"[2017, 2017, 2017, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2018, 2016, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2015, 2017]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"The quantification of peptides using targeted analysis of data-independent acquisition MS (DIA-MS) is dependent on the size and characteristics of the assay library. We addressed several important questions on how library composition influences: (1) the number of peptides extracted from DIA-MS datasets, (2) the quality of these peptides and proteins, and (3) the biological conclusions inferred. To answer these questions we constructed five libraries from mouse vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) lysate, each unique in depth, input sample complexity, data acquisition mode (DDA-MS or DIA-MS), and precursor fragmentation mode (TOF-CID or Orbitrap HCD) and extracted them against the same eight DIA-MS files of VSMCs treated with vehicle or transforming growth factor β-1 (TGF-β1). We found that along with differences in peptide and protein composition, the fragments representing a given peptide differed between the libraries. Collectively these differences impacted both peak group score profile and protein abundance estimates. Surprisingly, there was little overlap in the TGF-β1 response proteome between libraries.

"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the progressive deterioration of motor neurons in the cortex and spinal cord. Using an automated robotic microscope platform that enables the longitudinal tracking of thousands of single neurons, we examine the effects a large library of compounds on modulating the survival of primary neurons expressing a mutation known to cause ALS. The goal of our analysis is to identify the few potentially beneficial compounds among the many assayed, the vast majority of which do not extend neuronal survival. This resembles the large-scale simultaneous inference scenario familiar from microarray analysis, but transferred to the survival analysis setting due to the novel experimental setup.

"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disease primarily characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons, and caused by reduced levels of the SMN protein. Previous studies to understand the proteomic consequences of reduced SMN have mostly utilized patient fibroblasts and animal models. We have derived human motor neurons from type I SMA and healthy controls by creating their induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Quantitative mass spectrometry of these cells revealed increased expression of 63 proteins in control motor neurons compared to respective fibroblasts, whereas 30 proteins were increased in SMA motor neurons vs. their fibroblasts. Notably, UBA1 was significantly decreased in SMA motor neurons, supporting evidence for ubiquitin pathway defects. Subcellular distribution of UBA1 was predominantly cytoplasmic in SMA motor neurons in contrast to nuclear in control motor neurons; suggestive of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Many of the proteins that were decreased in SMA motor neurons, including beta III-tubulin and UCHL1, were associated with neurodevelopment and differentiation. These neuron-specific consequences of SMN depletion were not evident in fibroblasts, highlighting the importance of iPSC technology. The proteomic profiles identified here provide a useful resource to explore the molecular consequences of reduced SMN in motor neurons, and for the identification of novel biomarker and therapeutic targets for SMA.",0.0,Spinal muscular atrophy patient iPSC-derived motor neurons have reduced expression of proteins important in neuronal development.,0.0,"Mandefro B, Sareen D, Fuller HR, Shirran SL, Gross AR, Kaus AS, Botting CH, Morris GE",,1.0,,5/19/16 18:33,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,,26793058.0,PMC4707261,506,51.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,5/19/16 18:33,9,2016.0,PMC4707261,"['6085701', '5661640', '5250550', '6014456', '5932832', '6077828', '5033939', '4857123', '5012159', '5676863']",10.0,"[2018, 2017, 2016, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2017]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Profiling posttranslational modifications represents an alternative dimension to gene expression data in characterizing cellular processes. Many cellular responses to drugs are mediated by changes in cellular phosphosignaling. We sought to develop a common platform on which phosphosignaling responses could be profiled across thousands of samples, and created a targeted MS assay that profiles a reduced-representation set of phosphopeptides that we show to be strong indicators of responses to chemical perturbagens. To develop the assay, we investigated the coordinate regulation of phosphosites in samples derived from three cell lines treated with 26 different bioactive small molecules. Phosphopeptide analytes were selected from these discovery studies by clustering and picking 1 to 2 proxy members from each cluster. A quantitative, targeted PRM assay was developed to directly measure 96 reduced-representation probes. Sample processing for proteolytic digestion, protein quantification, peptide desalting, and phosphopeptide enrichment have been fully automated, making possible the simultaneous processing of 96 samples in only 3 days, with a plate phosphopeptide enrichment variance of 12%. This highly reproducible process allowed ~95% of the reduced-representation phosphopeptide probes to be detected in ~200 samples. The performance of the assay was evaluated by measuring the probes in new samples generated under treatment conditions from discovery experiments, recapitulating the observations of deeper experiments using a fraction of the analytical effort. We measured these probes in new experiments varying the treatments, cell types, and timepoints to demonstrate generalizability. We demonstrated that the assay is sensitive to disruptions in common signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK, PI3K/mTOR, and CDK). The high-throughput, reduced-representation phosphoproteomics assay provides a platform for the comparison of perturbations across a range of biological conditions, suitable for profiling thousands of samples.

"MOTIVATION: Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are a central consideration during drug development. Here we present a machine learning classifier to prioritize ADRs for approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by combining chemical structure (CS) and gene expression (GE) features.

Using various ben-chmarking methods, we show that the integration of GE data with the CS of the drugs can significantly improve the predictability of ADRs. Moreover, transforming GE features to enrichment vectors of biological terms further improves the predictive capability of the classifiers.

"Reproducibility is vital in science. For complex computational methods, it is often necessary, not just to recreate the code, but also the software and hardware environment to reproduce results.

"Drug sensitivity and resistance are conventionally quantified by IC50 or Emax values, but these metrics are highly sensitive to the number of divisions taking place over the course of a response assay. The dependency of IC50 and Emax on division rate creates artefactual correlations between genotype and drug sensitivity, while obscuring valuable biological insights and interfering with biomarker discovery. We derive alternative small molecule drug-response metrics that are insensitive to division number. These are based on estimation of the magnitude of drug-induced growth rate inhibition (GR) using endpoint or time-course assays. We show that GR50 and GRmax are superior to conventional metrics for assessing the effects of small molecule drugs in dividing cells. Moreover, adopting GR metrics requires only modest changes in experimental protocols.

"In recent years, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq) has become a fundamental tool of epigenomic research. However, it is difficult to perform this technique on frozen samples because freezing cells before extracting nuclei can impair nuclear integrity and alter chromatin structure, especially in fragile cells such as neurons. Our aim was to develop a protocol for freezing neuronal cells that is compatible with ATAC-Seq; we focused on a disease-relevant cell type, namely motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iMNs) from a patient affected by spinal muscular atrophy. We found that while flash-frozen iMNs are not suitable for ATAC-Seq, the assay is successful with slow-cooled cryopreserved cells. Using this method, we were able to isolate high quality, intact nuclei, and we verified that epigenetic results from fresh and cryopreserved iMNs quantitatively agree.",0.0,Cell freezing protocol suitable for ATAC-Seq on motor neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.,1.0,"Milani P, Escalante-Chong R, Shelley BC, Patel-Murray NL, Xin X, Adam M, Mandefro B, Sareen D, Svendsen CN, Fraenkel E",,1.0,,6/1/16 23:13,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1038/srep25474,,Scientific Reports,,27146274.0,PMC4857123,25474,60.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,6,2016.0,PMC4857123,"['5117701', '5333448', '5831847', '6029614']",4.0,"[2016, 2017, 2018, 2017]",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The method naturally steers solutions toward sets of mechanistically interlinked genes. Using experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that pathway-guided results maintain, and often improve, the accuracy of predictors even in cases where the full gene network is unknown.

"The cellular composition of a tumor greatly influences the growth, spread, immune activity, drug response, and other aspects of the disease. Tumor cells are usually comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of subclones, each of which could contain their own distinct character. The presence of minor subclones poses a serious health risk for patients as any one of them could harbor a fitness advantage with respect to the current treatment regimen, fueling resistance. It is therefore vital to accurately assess the make-up of cell states within a tumor biopsy. Transcriptome-wide assays from RNA sequencing provide key data from which cell state signatures can be detected. However, the challenge is to find them within samples containing mixtures of cell types of unknown proportions. We propose a novel one-class method based on logistic regression and show that its performance is competitive to two established SVM-based methods for this detection task. We demonstrate that one-class models are able to identify specific cell types in heterogeneous cell populations better than their binary predictor counterparts. We derive one-class predictors for the major breast and bladder subtypes and reaffirm the connection between these two tissues.

"High-throughput, 'omic' methods provide sensitive measures of biological responses to perturbations. However, inherent biases in high-throughput assays make it difficult to interpret experiments in which more than one type of data is collected. In this work, we introduce Omics Integrator, a software package that takes a variety of 'omic' data as input and identifies putative underlying molecular pathways. The approach applies advanced network optimization algorithms to a network of thousands of molecular interactions to find high-confidence, interpretable subnetworks that best explain the data. These subnetworks connect changes observed in gene expression, protein abundance or other global assays to proteins that may not have been measured in the screens due to inherent bias or noise in measurement. This approach reveals unannotated molecular pathways that would not be detectable by searching pathway databases. Omics Integrator also provides an elegant framework to incorporate not only positive data, but also negative evidence. Incorporating negative evidence allows Omics Integrator to avoid unexpressed genes and avoid being biased toward highly-studied hub proteins, except when they are strongly implicated by the data. The software is comprised of two individual tools, Garnet and Forest, that can be run together or independently to allow a user to perform advanced integration of multiple types of high-throughput data as well as create condition-specific subnetworks of protein interactions that best connect the observed changes in various datasets.",0.0,Network-based interpretation of diverse high-throughput datasets through the Omics Integrator software package.,0.0,"Tuncbag N, Gosline SJ, Kedaigle A, Soltis AR, Gitter A, Fraenkel E",,1.0,,6/23/16 0:00,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004879,4,PLoS Computational Biology,,27096930.0,PMC4838263 ,e1004879,72.0,"{\Omics Integrator\"":\""http://fraenkel.mit.edu/omicsintegrator\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,12,2016.0,PMC4838263,"['5352148', '5734865', '5552342', '5796629', '5224708', '5940180', '5859574', '5797227', '5905700', '5136524', '5614607', '5388136', '5799026']",13.0,"[2017, 0, 2017, 2018, 2016, 2018, 2017, 2018, 0, 2016, 2017, 2017, 2017]",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics efforts rapidly generate a plethora of data on the activity and levels of biomolecules within mammalian cells. At the same time, curation projects that organize knowledge from the biomedical literature into online databases are expanding. Hence, there is a wealth of information about genes, proteins and their associations, with an urgent need for data integration to achieve better knowledge extraction and data reuse. For this purpose, we developed the Harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins from over 70 major online resources. We extracted, abstracted and organized data into ∼72 million functional associations between genes/proteins and their attributes. Such attributes could be physical relationships with other biomolecules, expression in cell lines and tissues, genetic associations with knockout mouse or human phenotypes, or changes in expression after drug treatment. We stored these associations in a relational database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins, their attributes and the original resources. The freely available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user interface, a web service and a mobile app for querying, browsing and downloading all of the collected data. To demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome, we computed and visualized gene-gene and attribute-attribute similarity networks, and through unsupervised clustering, identified many unexpected relationships by combining pairs of datasets such as the association between kinase perturbations and disease signatures. We also applied supervised machine learning methods to predict novel substrates for kinases, endogenous ligands for G-protein coupled receptors, mouse phenotypes for knockout genes, and classified unannotated transmembrane proteins for likelihood of being ion channels. The Harmonizome is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and proteins, and as such, it enables researchers to discover novel relationships between biological entities, as well as form novel data-driven hypotheses for experimental validation.Database URL: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome.",1.0,The Harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins.,0.0,"Rouillard AD, Gundersen GW, Fernandez NF, Wang Z, Monteiro CD, McDermott MG, Ma'ayan A",,1.0,,7/28/16 0:00,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1093/database/baw100,,Database (Oxford),,27374120.0,PMC4930834,,73.0,"{\Harmonizome\"":\""http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,baw100,2016.0,PMC4930834,"['6082722', '5613673', '6068163', '5660716', '5597596', '5708133', '5948854', '5882811', '5210555', '5979006', '5668012', '5960281', '5634325', '6006150', '5748993', '5730357', '5955133', '5836265', '5819998', '5545976', '5534955', '6048556', '5705211', '5983857', '5625929', '5798844', '5768633', '5393943', '5984374', '5893633', '5869589', '5210543', '5799026', '5299575', '5676875', '5591525', '5559309', '5961183']",38.0,"[2018, 2017, 2018, 2017, 2017, 0, 2018, 2018, 2016, 2018, 2017, 2018, 2017, 2018, 0, 2017, 2018, 2018, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2018, 2017, 2018, 2017, 2018, 2018, 2017, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2016, 2017, 0, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2018]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) L1000 data set currently comprises of over a million gene expression profiles of chemically perturbed human cell lines. Through unique several intrinsic and extrinsic benchmarking schemes, we demonstrate that processing the L1000 data with the characteristic direction (CD) method significantly improves signal to noise compared with the MODZ method currently used to compute L1000 signatures. The CD processed L1000 signatures are served through a state-of-the-art web-based search engine application called L1000CDS2. The L1000CDS2 search engine provides prioritization of thousands of small-molecule signatures, and their pairwise combinations, predicted to either mimic or reverse an input gene expression signature using two methods. The L1000CDS2 search engine also predicts drug targets for all the small molecules profiled by the L1000 assay that we processed. Targets are predicted by computing the cosine similarity between the L1000 small-molecule signatures and a large collection of signatures extracted from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) for single-gene perturbations in mammalian cells. We applied L1000CDS2 to prioritize small molecules that are predicted to reverse expression in 670 disease signatures also extracted from GEO, and prioritized small molecules that can mimic expression of 22 endogenous ligand signatures profiled by the L1000 assay. As a case study, to further demonstrate the utility of L1000CDS2, we collected expression signatures from human cells infected with Ebola virus at 30, 60 and 120 min. Querying these signatures with L1000CDS2 we identified kenpaullone, a GSK3B/CDK2 inhibitor that we show, in subsequent experiments, has a dose-dependent efficacy in inhibiting Ebola infection in vitro without causing cellular toxicity in human cell lines.

"RNA-seq analysis is becoming a standard method for global gene expression profiling. However, open and standard pipelines to perform RNA-seq analysis by non-experts remain challenging due to the large size of the raw data files and the hardware requirements for running the alignment step. Here we introduce a reproducible open source RNA-seq pipeline delivered as an IPython notebook and a Docker image. The pipeline uses state-of-the-art tools and can run on various platforms with minimal configuration overhead. The pipeline enables the extraction of knowledge from typical RNA-seq studies by generating interactive principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HC) plots, performing enrichment analyses against over 90 gene set libraries, and obtaining lists of small molecules that are predicted to either mimic or reverse the observed changes in mRNA expression. We apply the pipeline to a recently published RNA-seq dataset collected from human neuronal progenitors infected with the Zika virus (ZIKV). In addition to confirming the presence of cell cycle genes among the genes that are downregulated by ZIKV, our analysis uncovers significant overlap with upregulated genes that when knocked out in mice induce defects in brain morphology. This result potentially points to the molecular processes associated with the microcephaly phenotype observed in newborns from pregnant mothers infected with the virus. In addition, our analysis predicts small molecules that can either mimic or reverse the expression changes induced by ZIKV.

This approach produced a maturation scale revealing that iPSC-derived spMNs were more similar to fetal spinal tissue than to adult spMNs.

"Various genetic mutations associated with cancer are known to alter cell signaling, but it is not clear whether they dysregulate signaling pathways by altering the abundance of pathway proteins. Using a combination of RNA sequencing and ultrasensitive targeted proteomics, we defined the primary components-16 core proteins and 10 feedback regulators-of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in normal human mammary epithelial cells and then quantified their absolute abundance across a panel of normal and breast cancer cell lines as well as fibroblasts. We found that core pathway proteins were present at very similar concentrations across all cell types, with a variance similar to that of proteins previously shown to display conserved abundances across species. In contrast, EGFR and transcriptionally controlled feedback regulators were present at highly variable concentrations. The absolute abundance of most core proteins was between 50,000 and 70,000 copies per cell, but the adaptors SOS1, SOS2, and GAB1 were found at far lower amounts (2000 to 5000 copies per cell). MAPK signaling showed saturation in all cells between 3000 and 10,000 occupied EGFRs, consistent with the idea that adaptors limit signaling. Our results suggest that the relative stoichiometry of core MAPK pathway proteins is very similar across different cell types, with cell-specific differences mostly restricted to variable amounts of feedback regulators and receptors. The low abundance of adaptors relative to EGFR could be responsible for previous observations that only a fraction of total cell surface EGFR is capable of rapid endocytosis, high-affinity binding, and mitogenic signaling.",0.0,Conservation of protein abundance patterns reveals the regulatory architecture of the EGFR-MAPK pathway.,0.0,"Shi T, Niepel M, McDermott JE, Gao Y, Nicora CD, Chrisler WB, Markillie LM, Petyuk VA, Smith RD, Rodland KD, Sorger PK, Qian WJ, Wiley HS",,1.0,,9/13/16 0:00,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.1126/scisignal.aaf0891,436,Science Signaling,,27405981.0,,rs6,91.0,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,,9,2016.0,PMC5036860,"['5754200', '5741375', '5607260', '6042839', '5473928', '5650921', '6089676', '5572301', '5731347', '5293153', '5461961', '5844524', '5886578', '5912210']",14.0,"[2018, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2018, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2018, 2018, 2018]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"BACKGROUND:
Genome-wide gene expression profiling of mammalian cells is becoming a staple of many published biomedical and biological research studies. Such data is deposited into data repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for potential reuse. However, these repositories currently do not provide simple interfaces to systematically analyze collections of related studies.
RESULTS:
Here we present GENE Expression and Enrichment Vector Analyzer (GEN3VA), a web-based system that enables the integrative analysis of aggregated collections of tagged gene expression signatures identified and extracted from GEO. Each tagged collection of signatures is presented in a report that consists of heatmaps of the differentially expressed genes; principal component analysis of all signatures; enrichment analysis with several gene set libraries across all signatures, which we term enrichment vector analysis; and global mapping of small molecules that are predicted to reverse or mimic each signature in the aggregate. We demonstrate how GEN3VA can be used to identify common molecular mechanisms of aging by analyzing tagged signatures from 244 studies that compared young vs. old tissues in mammalian systems. In a second case study, we collected 86 signatures from treatment of human cells with dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist. Our analysis confirms consensus GR target genes and predicts potential drug mimickers.
CONCLUSIONS:
GEN3VA can be used to identify, aggregate, and analyze themed collections of gene expression signatures from diverse but related studies. Such integrative analyses can be used to address concerns about data reproducibility, confirm results across labs, and discover new collective knowledge by data reuse.

"Activation of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) contributes to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by damaging synovial membranes and generating inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells to the joint. In this paper we profile cytokine secretion by primary human SFs from healthy tissues and from donors with RA and show that SF activation by TNF, IL-1α, and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) cause secretion of multiple cytokines found at high levels in RA synovial fluids. We used interaction multiple linear regression to quantify therapeutic and countertherapeutic drug effects across activators and donors and found that the ability of drugs to block SF activation was strongly dependent on the identity of the activating cytokine. (5z)-7-oxozeaenol (5ZO), a preclinical drug that targets transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), was more effective at blocking SF activation across all contexts than the approved drug tofacitinib, which supports the development of molecules similar to 5ZO for use as RA therapeutics.",0.0,Profiling drugs for rheumatoid arthritis that inhibit synovial fibroblast activation.,0.0,"Jones DS, Jenney AP, Swantek JL, Burke JM, Lauffenburger DA, Sorger PK",,1.0,,11/28/16 0:00,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1038/nchembio.2211,1,Nature Chemical Biology,,27820799.0,,38-45,106.0,"{\Publication Summary\"": \""http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/jones-natchembiol-2016/\""}""",0.0,,,1.0,0.0,,13,2016.0,PMC5372219,"['5978689', '5932757', '5652455', '5702485', '5576570', '5797482', '5484535', '5972226']",8.0,"[2018, 2018, 2017, 2017, 0, 2018, 2016, 2018]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Neuronal inclusions of poly(GA), a protein unconventionally translated from G4C2 repeat expansions in C9ORF72, are abundant in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by this mutation. To investigate poly(GA) toxicity, we generated mice that exhibit poly(GA) pathology, neurodegeneration and behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of FTD and ALS. These phenotypes occurred in the absence of TDP-43 pathology and required poly(GA) aggregation. HR23 proteins involved in proteasomal degradation and proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport were sequestered by poly(GA) in these mice. HR23A and HR23B similarly colocalized to poly(GA) inclusions in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Sequestration was accompanied by an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and decreased xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) levels in mice, indicative of HR23A and HR23B dysfunction.

"The hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) GGGGCC (G4C2) in C9orf72 is the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Recent studies support an HRE RNA gain-of-function mechanism of neurotoxicity, and we previously identified protein interactors for the G4C2 RNA including RanGAP1. A candidate-based genetic screen in Drosophila expressing 30 G4C2 repeats identified RanGAP (Drosophila orthologue of human RanGAP1), a key regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport, as a potent suppressor of neurodegeneration. Enhancing nuclear import or suppressing nuclear export of proteins also suppresses neurodegeneration. RanGAP physically interacts with HRE RNA and is mislocalized in HRE-expressing flies, neurons from C9orf72 ALS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-derived neurons), and in C9orf72 ALS patient brain tissue. Nuclear import is impaired as a result of HRE expression in the fly model and in C9orf72 iPSC-derived neurons, and these deficits are rescued by small molecules and antisense oligonucleotides targeting the HRE G-quadruplexes.

"While developing a multiplexed phosphotyrosine peptide quantification assay, an unexpected observation was made: significant neutral loss from phosphotyrosine (pY) containing peptides. Using a 2000-member peptide library, we sought to systematically investigate this observation by comparing unlabeled peptides with the two highest-plex isobaric tags (iTRAQ8 and TMT10) across CID, HCD, and ETD fragmentation using high resolution high mass accuracy Orbitrap instrumentation. We found pY peptide neutral loss behavior was consistent with reduced proton mobility, and does not occur during ETD. The site of protonation at the peptide N-terminus changes from a primary to a tertiary amine as a result of TMT labeling which would increase the gas phase basicity and reduce proton mobility at this site. This change in fragmentation behavior has implications during instrument method development and interpretation of MS/MS spectra, and therefore ensuing follow-up studies. We show how sites not localized to tyrosine by search and site localization algorithms can be confidently reassigned to tyrosine using neutral loss and phosphotyrosine immonium ions.

"Treatment of BRAF-mutant melanomas with MAP kinase pathway inhibitors is paradigmatic of the promise of precision cancer therapy but also highlights problems with drug resistance that limit patient benefit. We use live-cell imaging, single-cell analysis, and molecular profiling to show that exposure of tumor cells to RAF/MEK inhibitors elicits a heterogeneous response in which some cells die, some arrest, and the remainder adapt to drug. Drug-adapted cells up-regulate markers of the neural crest (e.g., NGFR), a melanocyte precursor, and grow slowly. This phenotype is transiently stable, reverting to the drug-naïve state within 9 days of drug withdrawal. Transcriptional profiling of cell lines and human tumors implicates a c-Jun/ECM/FAK/Src cascade in de-differentiation in about one-third of cell lines studied; drug-induced changes in c-Jun and NGFR levels are also observed in xenograft and human tumors. Drugs targeting the c-Jun/ECM/FAK/Src cascade as well as BET bromodomain inhibitors increase the maximum effect (Emax) of RAF/MEK kinase inhibitors by promoting cell killing.

We undertook a transcriptome and functional analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BMECs (iBMEC) from HD patients or unaffected controls.

"The U1 small nuclear (sn)RNA (U1) is a multifunctional ncRNA, known for its pivotal role in pre-mRNA splicing and regulation of RNA 3' end processing events. We recently demonstrated that a new class of human U1-like snRNAs, the variant (v)U1 snRNAs (vU1s), also participate in pre-mRNA processing events. In this study, we show that several human vU1 genes are specifically upregulated in stem cells and participate in the regulation of cell fate decisions. Significantly, ectopic expression of vU1 genes in human skin fibroblasts leads to increases in levels of key pluripotent stem cell mRNA markers, including NANOG and SOX2. These results reveal an important role for vU1s in the control of key regulatory networks orchestrating the transitions between stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Moreover, vU1 expression varies inversely with U1 expression during differentiation and cell re-programming and this pattern of expression is specifically de-regulated in iPSC-derived motor neurons from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) type 1 patient's. Accordingly, we suggest that an imbalance in the vU1/U1 ratio, rather than an overall reduction in Uridyl-rich (U)-snRNAs, may contribute to the specific neuromuscular disease phenotype associated with SMA.",0.0,Variant U1 snRNAs are implicated in human pluripotent stem cell maintenance and neuromuscular disease.,0.0,"Vazquez-Arango P, Vowles J, Browne C, Hartfield E, Fernandes HJ, Mandefro B, Sareen D, James W, Wade-Martins R, Cowley SA, Murphy S, O'Reilly D",,1.0,,6/14/17 0:00,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1093/nar/gkw711,22,Nucleic Acids Research,,27536002.0,PMC5159530,10960-10973,139.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,44,2017.0,PMC5159530,[],0.0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Neural cultures derived from Huntington's disease (HD) patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells were used for 'omics' analyses to identify mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.

One-third of gene changes were in pathways regulating neuronal development and maturation. When mapped to stages of mouse striatal development, the profiles aligned with earlier embryonic stages of neuronal differentiation. We observed a strong correlation between HD-related histone marks, gene expression and unique peak profiles associated with dysregulated genes, suggesting a coordinated epigenetic program. Treatment with isoxazole-9, which targets key dysregulated pathways, led to amelioration of expanded polyglutamine repeat-associated phenotypes in neural cells and of cognitive impairment and synaptic pathology in HD model R6/2 mice.

"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are highly potent cancer therapeutics that have been linked with serious cardiotoxicity, including left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, and QT prolongation. TKI-induced cardiotoxicity is thought to result from interference with tyrosine kinase activity in cardiomyocytes, where these signaling pathways help to control critical processes such as survival signaling, energy homeostasis and excitation-contraction coupling. However, mechanistic understanding is limited at present due to the complexities of tyrosine kinase signaling and the wide range of targets inhibited by TKIs. Here we review the use of TKIs in cancer and the cardiotoxicities that have been reported, discuss potential mechanisms underlying cardiotoxicity, and describe recent progress in achieving a more systematic understanding of cardiotoxicity. In particular, we argue that future advances are likely to be enabled by studies that combine large-scale experimental measurements with Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) models describing biological mechanisms and dynamics. As such approaches have proven extremely valuable for understanding and predicting other types of cardiotoxicity, it is likely that QSP modeling can be successfully applied to cardiotoxicity induced by TKIs. We conclude by discussing a potential strategy for integrating genome-wide expression measurements with models, illustrate initial advances in applying this approach to cardiotoxicity, and describe challenges that must be overcome to truly develop a mechanistic and systematic understanding of cardiotoxicity caused by TKIs.",1.0,Mechanistic systems modeling to improve understanding and prediction of cardiotoxicity caused by targeted cancer therapeutics.,0.0,"Shim JV, Chun B, van Hasselt JGC, Birtwistle MR, Saucerman JJ, Sobie EA",,1.0,,0000-00-00 00:00:00,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.3389/fphys.2017.00651,,Frontiers in Physiology,,28951721.0,PMC5599787 ,651,149.0,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,8,2017.0,PMC5599787,[],0.0,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Measuring the potencies of small-molecule drugs in cell lines is a critical aspect of preclinical pharmacology.

The procedures for measuring drug response described here were developed by the NIH LINCS program to improve reproducibility. Key features include maximizing uniform cell growth during the assay period, accounting for the effects of cell density on response, and correcting sensitivity measures for differences in proliferation rates.

"More effective use of targeted anti-cancer drugs depends on elucidating the connection between the molecular states induced by drug treatment and the cellular phenotypes controlled by these states, such as cytostasis and death. This is particularly true when mutation of a single gene is inadequate as a predictor of drug response. The current paper describes a data set of ~600 drug cell line pairs collected as part of the NIH LINCS Program ( http://www.lincsproject.org/ ) in which molecular data (reduced dimensionality transcript L1000 profiles) were recorded across dose and time in parallel with phenotypic data on cellular cytostasis and cytotoxicity. We report that transcriptional and phenotypic responses correlate with each other in general, but whereas inhibitors of chaperones and cell cycle kinases induce similar transcriptional changes across cell lines, changes induced by drugs that inhibit intra-cellular signaling kinases are cell-type specific. In some drug/cell line pairs significant changes in transcription are observed without a change in cell growth or survival; analysis of such pairs identifies drug equivalence classes and, in one case, synergistic drug interactions.

"BACKGROUND: Quantifying the response of cell lines to drugs or other perturbagens is the cornerstone of pre-clinical drug development and pharmacogenomics as well as a means to study factors that contribute to sensitivity and resistance. In dividing cells, traditional metrics derived from dose-response curves such as IC 50 , AUC, and E max , are confounded by the number of cell divisions taking place during the assay, which varies widely for biological and experimental reasons. Hafner et al. (Nat Meth 13:521-627, 2016) recently proposed an alternative way to quantify drug response, normalized growth rate (GR) inhibition, that is robust to such confounders. Adoption of the GR method is expected to improve the reproducibility of dose-response assays and the reliability of pharmacogenomic associations (Hafner et al. 500-502, 2017).
RESULTS: We describe here an interactive website ( www.grcalculator.org ) for calculation, analysis, and visualization of dose-response data using the GR approach and for comparison of GR and traditional metrics. Data can be user-supplied or derived from published datasets. The web tools are implemented in the form of three integrated Shiny applications (grcalculator, grbrowser, and grtutorial) deployed through a Shiny server. Intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) allow for interactive analysis and visualization of data. The Shiny applications make use of two R packages (shinyLi and GRmetrics) specifically developed for this purpose. The GRmetrics R package is also available via Bioconductor and can be used for offline data analysis and visualization. Source code for the Shiny applications and associated packages (shinyLi and GRmetrics) can be accessed at www.github.com/uc-bd2k/grcalculator and www.github.com/datarail/gr_metrics .
CONCLUSIONS: GRcalculator is a powerful, user-friendly, and free tool to facilitate analysis of dose-response data. It generates publication-ready figures and provides a unified platform for investigators to analyze dose-response data across diverse cell types and perturbagens (including drugs, biological ligands, RNAi, etc.). GRcalculator also provides access to data collected by the NIH LINCS Program ( http://www.lincsproject.org /) and other public domain datasets. The GRmetrics Bioconductor package provides computationally trained users with a platform for offline analysis of dose-response data and facilitates inclusion of GR metrics calculations within existing R analysis pipelines.

"Traditional means for scoring the effects of anti-cancer drugs on the growth and survival of cell lines is based on relative cell number in drug-treated and control samples and is seriously confounded by unequal division rates arising from natural biological variation and differences in culture conditions. This problem can be overcome by computing drug sensitivity on a per-division basis. The normalized growth rate inhibition (GR) approach yields per-division metrics for drug potency (GR50) and efficacy (GRmax) that are analogous to the more familiar IC50 and Emax values. In this work, we report GR-based, proliferation-corrected, drug sensitivity metrics for ~4,700 pairs of breast cancer cell lines and perturbagens. Such data are broadly useful in understanding the molecular basis of therapeutic response and resistance. Here, we use them to investigate the relationship between different measures of drug sensitivity and conclude that drug potency and efficacy exhibit high variation that is only weakly correlated.

"OBJECTIVE: Bioinformatics publications typically include complex software workflows that are difficult to describe in a manuscript. We describe and demonstrate the use of interactive software notebooks to document and distribute bioinformatics research. We provide a user-friendly tool, BiocImageBuilder, that allows users to easily distribute their bioinformatics protocols through interactive notebooks uploaded to either a GitHub repository or a private server. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present four different interactive Jupyter notebooks using R and Bioconductor workflows to infer differential gene expression, analyze cross-platform datasets, process RNA-seq data and KinomeScan data. These interactive notebooks are available on GitHub. The analytical results can be viewed in a browser. Most importantly, the software contents can be executed and modified. This is accomplished using Binder, which runs the notebook inside software containers, thus avoiding the need to install any software and ensuring reproducibility. All the notebooks were produced using custom files generated by BiocImageBuilder. RESULTS: BiocImageBuilder facilitates the publication of workflows with a point-and-click user interface. We demonstrate that interactive notebooks can be used to disseminate a wide range of bioinformatics analyses. The use of software containers to mirror the original software environment ensures reproducibility of results. Parameters and code can be dynamically modified, allowing for robust verification of published results and encouraging rapid adoption of new methods.

"Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have typically been studied independently, yet many proteins are modified by more than one PTM type, and cell signaling pathways somehow integrate this information. We coupled immunoprecipitation using PTM-specific antibodies with tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to simultaneously examine phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation in 45 lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung tissue and to cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. This simultaneous, large-scale, integrative analysis of these PTMs using a cluster-filtered network (CFN) approach revealed that cell signaling pathways were outlined by clustering patterns in PTMs. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method to identify PTM clusters and then integrated each with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to elucidate functional cell signaling pathways. The CFN identified known and previously unknown cell signaling pathways in lung cancer cells that were not present in normal lung epithelial tissue. In various proteins modified by more than one type of PTM, the incidence of those PTMs exhibited inverse relationships, suggesting that molecular exclusive \OR\"" gates determine a large number of signal transduction events. We also showed that the acetyltransferase EP300 appears to be a hub in the network of pathways involving different PTMs. In addition, the data shed light on the mechanism of action of geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor.

We show that FOXO3 nuclear-to-cytosolic translocation has two temporally distinct phases varying in magnitude with growth factor identity and cell type. These phases comprise synchronous translocation soon after ligand addition followed by an extended back-and-forth shuttling; this shuttling is pulsatile and does not have a characteristic frequency, unlike a simple oscillator.

"Gene expression profiling of in vitro drug perturbations is useful for many biomedical discovery applications including drug repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms. However, limited data availability across cell types has hindered our capacity to leverage or explore the cell-specificity of these perturbations. While recent efforts have generated a large number of drug perturbation profiles across a variety of human cell types, many gaps remain in this combinatorial drug-cell space. Hence, we asked whether it is possible to fill these gaps by predicting cell-specific drug perturbation profiles using available expression data from related conditions--i.e. from other drugs and cell types. We developed a computational framework that first arranges existing profiles into a three-dimensional array (or tensor) indexed by drugs, genes, and cell types, and then uses either local (nearest-neighbors) or global (tensor completion) information to predict unmeasured profiles. We evaluate prediction accuracy using a variety of metrics, and find that the two methods have complementary performance, each superior in different regions in the drug-cell space. Predictions achieve correlations of 0.68 with true values, and maintain accurate differentially expressed genes (AUC 0.81).

"Integrating data from multiple regulatory layers across cancer types could elucidate additional mechanisms of oncogenesis. Using antibody-based protein profiling of 736 cancer cell lines, along with matching transcriptomic data, we show that pan-cancer bimodality in the amounts of mRNA, protein, and protein phosphorylation reveals mechanisms related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Based on the bimodal expression of E-cadherin, we define an EMT signature consisting of 239 genes, many of which were not previously associated with EMT.

"While gene expression data at the mRNA level can be globally and accurately measured, profiling the activity of cell signaling pathways is currently much more difficult. eXpression2Kinases (X2K) computationally predicts involvement of upstream cell signaling pathways, given a signature of differentially expressed genes. X2K first computes enrichment for transcription factors likely to regulate the expression of the differentially expressed genes. The next step of X2K connects these enriched transcription factors through known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to construct a subnetwork. The final step performs kinase enrichment analysis on the members of the subnetwork. X2K Web is a new implementation of the original eXpression2Kinases algorithm with important enhancements.

"The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project aims to create a network-based understanding of biology by cataloging changes in gene expression and signal transduction that occur when cells are exposed to a variety of perturbations. It is helpful for understanding cell pathways and facilitating drug discovery. Here, we developed a novel approach to infer cell-specific pathways and identify a compoundNULLs effects using gene expression and phosphoproteomics data under treatments with different compounds. Gene expression data were employed to infer potential targets of compounds and create a generic pathway map. Binary linear programming (BLP) was then developed to optimize the generic pathway topology based on the mid-stage signaling response of phosphorylation. To demonstrate effectiveness of this approach, we built a generic pathway map for the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and inferred the cell-specific pathways by BLP. The first group of 11 compounds was utilized to optimize the generic pathways, and then 4 compounds were used to identify effects based on the inferred cell-specific pathways. Cross-validation indicated that the cell-specific pathways reliably predicted a compoundNULLs effects. Finally, we applied BLP to re-optimize the cell-specific pathways to predict the effects of 4 compounds (trichostatin A, MS-275, staurosporine, and digoxigenin) according to compound-induced topological alterations. Trichostatin A and MS-275 (both HDAC inhibitors) inhibited the downstream pathway of HDAC1 and caused cell growth arrest via activation of p53 and p21; the effects of digoxigenin were totally opposite. Staurosporine blocked the cell cycle via p53 and p21, but also promoted cell growth via activated HDAC1 and its downstream pathway. Our approach was also applied to the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, and the cross-validation analysis showed very good accuracy in predicting effects of 4 compounds.

"The present study applies a systems biology approach for the in silico predictive modeling of drug toxicity on the basis of high-quality preclinical drug toxicity data with the aim of increasing the mechanistic understanding of toxic effects of compounds at different levels (pathway, cell, tissue, organ). The model development has been carried out using 77 compounds for which gene expression data are available in the LINCS database for primary human hepatocytes treated with the compounds, as well as rodent in vivo hepatotoxicity information is available in the eTOX database. The data from LINCS were used in a systems biology approach to determine the type and number of pathways disturbed by each compound, and to estimate the extent of disturbance (network perturbation elasticity), analyzing the correspondence with the in vivo information from eTOX. Predictive models were developed through this integrative analysis, and their specificity and sensitivity were assessed. The quality of the predictions was determined on the basis of the area under the curve (AUC) of plots of true positive vs. false positive rates (ROC curves). The ROC AUC reached values of up to 0.9 (out of 1.0) for some hepatotoxicity endpoints. Moreover, the most frequently disturbed metabolic pathways were determined across the studied toxicants.

"Chemical toxicity is conventionally evaluated in animal models. However, animal models are resource intensive; moreover, they face ethical and scientific challenges because the outcomes obtained by animal testing may not correlate with human responses. To develop an alternative method for assessing chemical toxicity, we investigated the feasibility of using chemical-induced genome-wide expression changes in cultured human cells to predict the potential of a chemical to cause specific organ injuries in humans. We first created signatures of chemical-induced gene expression in a vertebral-cancer of the prostate cell line for ~15,000 chemicals tested in the U.S. National Institutes of Health Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures program. We then used the signatures to create naïve Bayesian prediction models for chemical-induced human liver cholestasis, interstitial nephritis, and long QT syndrome. Detailed cross-validation analyses indicated that the models were robust with respect to false positives and false negatives in the samples we used to train the models, and could predict the likelihood that chemicals would cause specific organ injuries. In addition, we performed a literature search for drugs and dietary supplements, not formally categorized as causing organ injuries in humans but predicted by our models to be most likely to do so. We found a high percentage of these compounds associated with case reports of relevant organ injuries, lending support to the idea that in vitro cell-based experiments can be used to predict the toxic potential of chemicals.

Here, we combined a high-throughput gene expression profiling method with a tumor spheroid-based drug-screening assay to identify context-dependent treatment responses. As a proof of concept, we examined drug responses of quiescent cancer cells to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitors. Use of multicellular tumor spheroids led to discovery that the mevalonate pathway is upregulated in quiescent cells during OXPHOS inhibition, and that OXPHOS inhibitors and mevalonate pathway inhibitors were synergistically toxic to quiescent spheroids.

Mechanistic studies suggest that the compound undergoes zinc-catalyzed decomposition to an ortho-quinone methide, which covalently modifies nucleophilic cysteines within the proteins. The covalent nature of the compound-enzyme interaction has been demonstrated in experiments with biotinylated probe compound and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry.",0.0,Inhibition of zinc-dependent histone deacetylases with a chemically triggered electrophile.,0.0,"Boskovic ZV, Kemp MM, Freedy AM, Viswanathan VS, Pop MS, Fuller JH, Martinez NM, Figueroa Lazú SO, Hong JA, Lewis TA, Calarese D, Love JD, Vetere A, Almo SC, Schreiber SL, Koehler AN",,0.0,,1/13/17 0:00,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1021/acschembio.6b00012,7,ACS Chemical Biology,,27064299.0,,1844-51,117.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,11,2016.0,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Deep learning is rapidly advancing many areas of science and technology with multiple success stories in image, text, voice and video recognition, robotics, and autonomous driving. In this paper we demonstrate how deep neural networks (DNN) trained on large transcriptional response data sets can classify various drugs to therapeutic categories solely based on their transcriptional profiles. We used the perturbation samples of 678 drugs across A549, MCF-7, and PC-3 cell lines from the LINCS Project and linked those to 12 therapeutic use categories derived from MeSH. To train the DNN, we utilized both gene level transcriptomic data and transcriptomic data processed using a pathway activation scoring algorithm, for a pooled data set of samples perturbed with different concentrations of the drug for 6 and 24 hours. In both pathway and gene level classification, DNN achieved high classification accuracy and convincingly outperformed the support vector machine (SVM) model on every multiclass classification problem, however, models based on pathway level data performed significantly better. For the first time we demonstrate a deep learning neural net trained on transcriptomic data to recognize pharmacological properties of multiple drugs across different biological systems and conditions. We also propose using deep neural net confusion matrices for drug repositioning.

"The NIH-funded LINCS program has been initiated to generate a library of integrated, network-based, cellular signatures (LINCS). A novel high-throughput gene-expression profiling assay known as L1000 was the main technology used to generate more than a million transcriptional profiles. The profiles are based on the treatment of 14 cell lines with one of many perturbation agents of interest at a single concentration for 6 and 24 hours duration. In this study, we focus on the chemical compound treatments within the LINCS data set. The experimental variables available include number of replicates, cell lines, and time points. Our study reveals that compound characterization based on three cell lines at two time points results in more genes being affected than six cell lines at a single time point. Based on the available LINCS data, we conclude that the most optimal experimental design to characterize a large set of compounds is to test them in duplicate in three different cell lines. Our conclusions are constrained by the fact that the compounds were profiled at a single, relative high concentration, and the longer time point is likely to result in phenotypic rather than mechanistic effects being recorded.",0.0,Transcriptional characterization of compounds: Lessons learned from the public LINCS data.,0.0,"De Wolf H, De Bondt A, Turner H, Göhlmann HW",,0.0,,8/30/16 15:51,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.1089/adt.2016.715,4,Assay and Drug Development Technologies,,27187605.0,PMC487650,252-60,79.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,14,2016.0,PMC4876500,"['5763468', '5124246', '5192966']",3.0,"[2017, 2016, 2016]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Background: Gene expression connectivity mapping has proven to be a powerful and flexible tool for research. Its application has been shown in a broad range of research topics, most commonly as a means of identifying potential small molecule compounds, which may be further investigated as candidates for repurposing to treat diseases. The public release of voluminous data from the Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) programme further enhanced the utilities and potentials of gene expression connectivity mapping in biomedicine. Results: We describe QUADrATiC (http://go.qub.ac.uk/QUADrATiC), a user-friendly tool for the exploration of gene expression connectivity on the subset of the LINCS data set corresponding to FDA-approved small molecule compounds. It enables the identification of compounds for repurposing therapeutic potentials. The software is designed to cope with the increased volume of data over existing tools, by taking advantage of multicore computing architectures to provide a scalable solution, which may be installed and operated on a range of computers, from laptops to servers. This scalability is provided by the use of the modern concurrent programming paradigm provided by the Akka framework. The QUADrATiC Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed using advanced Javascript frameworks, providing novel visualization capabilities for further analysis of connections. There is also a web services interface, allowing integration with other programs or scripts. Conclusions: QUADrATiC has been shown to provide an improvement over existing connectivity map software, in terms of scope (based on the LINCS data set), applicability (using FDA-approved compounds), usability and speed. It offers potential to biological researchers to analyze transcriptional data and generate potential therapeutics for focussed study in the lab.

"Ozone is a common, potent oxidant pollutant in industrialized nations. Ozone exposure causes airway hyperreactivity, lung hyperpermeability, inflammation, and cell damage in humans and laboratory animals, and exposure to ozone has been associated with exacerbation of asthma, altered lung function, and mortality. The mechanisms of ozone-induced lung injury and differential susceptibility are not fully understood. Ozone-induced lung inflammation is mediated, in part, by the innate immune system. We hypothesized that mannose-binding lectin (MBL), an innate immunity serum protein, contributes to the proinflammatory events caused by ozone-mediated activation of the innate immune system. Wild-type (Mbl(+/+)) and MBL-deficient (Mbl(-/-)) mice were exposed to ozone (0.3 ppm) for up to 72 h, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was examined for inflammatory markers. Mean numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils and levels of the neutrophil attractants C-X-C motif chemokines 2 [Cxcl2 (major intrinsic protein 2)] and 5 [Cxcl5 (limb expression, LIX)] in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly lower in Mbl(-/-) than Mbl(+/+) mice exposed to ozone. Using genome-wide mRNA microarray analyses, we identified significant differences in transcript response profiles and networks at baseline [e.g., nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response] and after exposure (e.g., humoral immune response) between Mbl(+/+) and Mbl(-/-) mice. The microarray data were further analyzed to discover several informative differential response patterns and subsequent gene sets, including the antimicrobial response and the inflammatory response. We also used the lists of gene transcripts to search the LINCS L1000CDS(2) data sets to identify agents that are predicted to perturb ozone-induced changes in gene transcripts and inflammation. These novel findings demonstrate that targeted deletion of Mbl caused differential levels of inflammation-related gene sets at baseline and after exposure to ozone and significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation, thus indicating an important innate immunomodulatory role of the gene in this model.",0.0,Effects of mannose-binding lectin on pulmonary gene expression and innate immune inflammatory response to ozone.,0.0,"Ciencewicki JM, Verhein KC, Gerrish K, McCaw ZR, Li J, Bushel PR, Kleeberger SR",,0.0,,8/30/16 15:51,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1152/ajplung.00205.2015,2,American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,,27106289.0,,L280-91,82.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,311,2016.0,PMC5005272,"['5486273', '5596881']",2.0,"[2017, 2016]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Polypharmacology (the ability of a drug to affect more than one molecular target) is considered a basic property of many therapeutic small molecules. Herein, we used a chemical genomics approach to systematically analyze polypharmacology by integrating several analytical tools, including the LINCS (Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures), STITCH (Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals), and WebGestalt (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit). We applied this approach to identify functional disparities between two cytidine nucleoside analogs: azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC). AZA and DAC are structurally and mechanistically similar DNA-hypomethylating agents. However, their metabolism and destinations in cells are distinct. Due to their differential incorporation into RNA or DNA, functional disparities between AZA and DAC are expected. Indeed, different cytotoxicities of AZA and DAC toward human colorectal cancer cell lines were observed, in which cells were more sensitive to AZA. Based on a polypharmacological analysis, we found that AZA transiently blocked protein synthesis and induced an acute apoptotic response that was antagonized by concurrently induced cytoprotective autophagy. In contrast, DAC caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase associated with p53 induction. Therefore, our study discriminated functional disparities between AZA and DAC, and also demonstrated the value of this chemical genomics approach that can be applied to discover novel drug action mechanisms.",0.0,Systematic discovery of drug action mechanisms by an integrated chemical genomics approach: identification of functional disparities between azacytidine and decitabine.,0.0,"Hsieh YY, Huang TC, Lo HL, Jhan JY, Chen ST, Yang PM",,0.0,,8/30/16 15:51,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.18632/oncotarget.8455,19,Oncotarget,,27036028.0,,27363-78,83.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,7,2016.0,PMC5053656,[],0.0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only ~1,000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression, limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expression of genes. Results: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based GEO dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms linear regression with 15.33% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than linear regression in 99.97% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2,921 expression profiles.

"We aimed to define the chronically altered gene expression signature of traumatic brain injury (TBI-sig) to discover novel treatments to reverse pathologic gene expression or reinforce the expression of recovery-related genes. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing was performed at 3 months post-TBI induced by lateral fluid-percussion injury in rats. We found 4964 regulated genes in the perilesional cortex and 1966 in the thalamus (FDR < 0.05). TBI-sig was used for a LINCS analysis which identified 11 compounds that showed a strong connectivity with the TBI-sig in neuronal cell lines.

"Patients with oncogene driven tumors are treated with targeted therapeutics including EGFR inhibitors. Genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrates molecular alterations to EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways in previously untreated tumors. Therefore, this study uses bioinformatics algorithms to delineate interactions resulting from EGFR inhibitor use in cancer cells with these genetic alterations. We modify the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line model to simulate cancer cells with constitutive activation of EGFR, HRAS, and PI3K in a controlled genetic background. We then measure gene expression after treating modified HaCaT cells with gefitinib, afatinib, and cetuximab. The CoGAPS algorithm distinguishes a gene expression signature associated with the anticipated silencing of the EGFR network. It also infers a feedback signature with EGFR gene expression itself increasing in cells that are responsive to EGFR inhibitors. This feedback signature has increased expression of several growth factor receptors regulated by the AP-2 family of transcription factors. The gene expression signatures for AP-2alpha are further correlated with sensitivity to cetuximab treatment in HNSCC cell lines and changes in EGFR expression in HNSCC tumors with low CDKN2A gene expression. In addition, the AP-2alpha gene expression signatures are also associated with inhibition of MEK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways in the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data.

Interrogation of the 5q trans-effects against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures, connected loss of CETN3 and SKP1 to elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC tyrosine kinase.

Its L1000 platform utilizes 978 landmark genes to infer the transcript levels of 14,292 genes computationally. Here we conducted the L1000 data quality control analysis by using MCF7, PC3, and A375 cell lines as representative examples. Before perturbations, a promising 80% correlation in transcriptome was observed between L1000- and Affymetrix HU133A-platforms. After library-based shRNA perturbations, a moderate 30% of differentially expressed genes overlapped between any two selected controls viral vectors using the L1000 platform. The mitogen-activated protein kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and T-cell receptor pathways were identified as the most significantly shared pathways between chemical and genetic perturbations in cancer cells. In conclusion, L1000 platform is reliable in assessing transcriptome before perturbation. Its response to perturbagens needs to be interpreted with caution.

"BACKGROUND: Aberrant patterns of DNA methylation are abundant in cancer, and epigenetic pathways are increasingly being targeted in cancer drug treatment. Genetic components of the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism pathway can affect DNA methylation and other vital cell functions, including DNA synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and cell growth.
RESULTS: We used a bioinformatics tool, the Transcriptional Pharmacology Workbench, to analyze temporal changes in gene expression among epigenetic regulators of DNA methylation and demethylation, and one-carbon metabolism genes in response to cancer drug treatment. We analyzed gene expression information from the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel after treatment with five antitumor agents, 5-azacytidine, doxorubicin, vorinostat, paclitaxel, and cisplatin. Each antitumor agent elicited concerted changes in gene expression of multiple pathway components across the cell lines. Expression changes of FOLR2, SMUG1, GART, GADD45A, MBD1, MTR, MTHFD1, and CTH were significantly correlated with chemosensitivity to some of the agents. Among many genes with concerted expression response to individual antitumor agents were genes encoding DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, epigenetic and DNA repair factors MGMT, GADD45A, and MBD1, and one-carbon metabolism pathway members MTHFD1, TYMS, DHFR, MTR, MAT2A, SLC19A1, ATIC, and GART.
CONCLUSIONS: These transcriptional changes are likely to influence vital cellular functions of DNA methylation and demethylation, cellular growth, DNA biosynthesis, and DNA repair, and some of them may contribute to cytotoxic and apoptotic action of the drugs. This concerted molecular response was observed in a time-dependent manner, which may provide future guidelines for temporal selection of genetic drug targets for combination drug therapy treatment regimens.",0.0,"Concerted changes in transcriptional regulation of genes involved in DNA methylation, demethylation, and folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism pathways in the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel in response to cancer drug treatment.",0.0,"Krushkal J, Zhao Y, Hose C, Monks A, Doroshow JH, Simon R",,0.0,,1/13/17 0:00,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.1186/s13148-016-0240-3,,Clinical Epigenetics,,27347216.0,PMC4919895 ,73,116.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,8,2016.0,PMC4919895,"['5940885', '5734428']",2.0,"[2018, 2017]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"An in silico chemical genomics approach is developed to predict drug repositioning (DR) candidates for three types of cancer: glioblastoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. It is based on a recent large-scale dataset of ~20,000 drug-induced expression profiles in multiple cancer cell lines, which provides i) a global impact of transcriptional perturbation of both known targets and unknown off-targets, and ii) rich information on drug's mode-of-action. First, the drug-induced expression profile is shown more effective than other information, such as the drug structure or known target, using multiple HTS datasets as unbiased benchmarks. Particularly, the utility of our method was robustly demonstrated in identifying novel DR candidates. Second, we predicted 14 high-scoring DR candidates solely based on expression signatures. Eight of the fourteen drugs showed significant anti-proliferative activity against glioblastoma; i.e., ivermectin, trifluridine, astemizole, amlodipine, maprotiline, apomorphine, mometasone, and nortriptyline. Our DR score strongly correlated with that of cell-based experimental results; the top seven DR candidates were positive, corresponding to an approximately 20-fold enrichment compared with conventional HTS. Despite diverse original indications and known targets, the perturbed pathways of active DR candidates show five distinct patterns that form tight clusters together with one or more known cancer drugs, suggesting common transcriptome-level mechanisms of anti-proliferative activity.",1.0,Drug repositioning for cancer therapy based on large-scale drug-Induced transcriptional signatures.,0.0,"Lee H, Kang S, Kim W",,0.0,,3/30/17 0:00,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0150460,3,PLoS One,,26954019.0,PMC4783079,e0150460,126.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,11,2016.0,PMC4783079,"['6097480', '4916325', '5864870', '5664374', '5835698', '5724417']",6.0,"[2018, 2016, 2018, 2017, 2018, 2017]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) fail to control seizures in 30% of patients. Genomics-based drug repurposing (GBR) offers the potential of savings in the time and cost of developing new AEDs. In the current study, we used published data and software to identify the transcriptomic signature of chornic temporal lobe epilepsy and the drugs that reverse it. After filtering out compounds based on exclusion criteria, such as toxicity, 36 drugs were retained. 11 of the 36 drugs identified (>30%) have published evidence of antiepileptic efficacy (for example, curcumin) or antiepileptogenic affect (for example, atorvastatin) in recognised rodent models or patients. By objectively annotating all ∼20,000 compounds in the LINCS database as either having published evidence of antiepileptic efficacy or lacking such evidence, we demonstrated that our set of repurposable drugs is ∼6-fold more enriched with drugs having published evidence of antiepileptic efficacy in animal models than expected by chance (p-value <0.006). Further, we showed that another of our GBR-identified drugs, the commonly-used well-tolerated antihyperglycemic sitagliptin, produces a dose-dependent reduction in seizures in a mouse model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy.

"Over the past couple of years, the cost of drug development has sharply increased along with the high rate of clinical trial failures. Such increase in expenses is partially due to the inability of the “one drug – one target” approach to predict drug side effects and toxicities. To tackle this issue, an alternative approach, known as polypharmacology, is being adopted to study small molecule interactions with multiple targets. Apart from developing more potent and effective drugs, this approach allows for studies of off-target activities and the facilitation of drug repositioning.

"An excess or dysregulated host inflammatory responses cause much of the morbidity and mortality caused by severe influenza. Given the limitations of vaccines and antiviral drugs, novel therapeutics to modulate host responses and improve outcomes in severe influenza are needed.

This review surveys the results of lung transcriptome profiling studies in murine models that directly compare susceptible versus resistant hosts challenged with identical influenza infections. The potential contributions and limitations of these studies are discussed.

"Identification of drug targets and mechanism of action (MoA) for new and uncharacterized anticancer drugs is important for optimization of treatment efficacy. Current MoA prediction largely relies on prior information including side effects, therapeutic indication, and chemo-informatics. Such information is not transferable or applicable for newly identified, previously uncharacterized small molecules. Therefore, a shift in the paradigm of MoA predictions is necessary towards development of unbiased approaches that can elucidate drug relationships and efficiently classify new compounds with basic input data. We propose here a new integrative computational pharmacogenomic approach, referred to as Drug Network Fusion (DNF), to infer scalable drug taxonomies that relies only on basic drug characteristics towards elucidating drug-drug relationships. DNF is the first framework to integrate drug structural information, high-throughput drug perturbation, and drug sensitivity profiles, enabling drug classification of new experimental compounds with minimal prior information. DNF taxonomy succeeded in identifying pertinent and novel drug-drug relationships, making it suitable for investigating experimental drugs with potential new targets or MoA. The scalability of DNF facilitated identification of key drug relationships across different drug categories and poses as a flexible tool for potential clinical applications in precision medicine. Our results support DNF as a valuable resource to the cancer research community by providing new hypotheses on compound MoA and potential insights for drug repurposing.",1.0,Integrative cancer pharmacogenomics to infer large-scale drug taxonomy.,0.0,"El-Hachem N, Gendoo DM, Soltan Ghoraie L, Safikhani Z, Smirnov P, Chung C, Deng K, Fang A, Birkwood E, Ho C, Isserlin R, Bader G, Goldenberg A, Haibe-Kains B",,0.0,,0000-00-00 00:00:00,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0096,11,Cancer Research,,28314784.0,,3057-3069,131.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,77,2017.0,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mebendazole (MBZ), a drug commonly used for helminitic infections, has recently gained substantial attention as a repositioning candidate for cancer treatment. However, the mechanism of action behind its anticancer activity remains unclear. To address this problem, we took advantage of the curated MBZ-induced gene expression signatures in the LINCS Connectivity Map (CMap) database. The analysis revealed strong negative correlation with MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitors. Moreover, several of the most upregulated genes in response to MBZ exposure were related to monocyte/macrophage activation. The MBZ-induced gene expression signature in the promyeloblastic HL-60 cell line was strongly enriched in genes involved in monocyte/macrophage pro-inflammatory (M1) activation. This was subsequently validated using MBZ-treated THP-1 monocytoid cells that demonstrated gene expression, surface markers and cytokine release characteristic of the M1 phenotype. At high concentrations MBZ substantially induced the release of IL-1β and this was further potentiated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At low MBZ concentrations, cotreatment with LPS was required for MBZ-stimulated IL-1β secretion to occur. Furthermore, we show that the activation of protein kinase C, ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB were required for MBZ-induced IL-1β release.

"The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach has been used to model a wide range of chemical-induced biological responses. However, it had not been utilized to model chemical-induced genomewide gene expression changes until very recently, owing to the complexity of training and evaluating a very large number of models. To address this issue, we examined the performance of a variable nearest neighbor (v-NN) method that uses information on near neighbors conforming to the principle that similar structures have similar activities. Using a data set of gene expression signatures of 13 150 compounds derived from cell-based measurements in the NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures program, we were able to make predictions for 62% of the compounds in a 10-fold cross validation test, with a correlation coefficient of 0.61 between the predicted and experimentally derived signatures-a reproducibility rivaling that of high-throughput gene expression measurements. To evaluate the utility of the predicted gene expression signatures, we compared the predicted and experimentally derived signatures in their ability to identify drugs known to cause specific liver, kidney, and heart injuries. Overall, the predicted and experimentally derived signatures had similar receiver operating characteristics, whose areas under the curve ranged from 0.71 to 0.77 and 0.70 to 0.73, respectively, across the three organ injury models. However, detailed analyses of enrichment curves indicate that signatures predicted from multiple near neighbors outperformed those derived from experiments, suggesting that averaging information from near neighbors may help improve the signal from gene expression measurements.

"Phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) approaches do not rely on knowledge of the identity of a specific drug target or a hypothesis about its role in disease, in contrast to the target-based strategies that have been widely used in the pharmaceutical industry in the past three decades. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence in interest in PDD approaches based on their potential to address the incompletely understood complexity of diseases and their promise of delivering first-in-class drugs, as well as major advances in the tools for cell-based phenotypic screening. Nevertheless, PDD approaches also have considerable challenges, such as hit validation and target deconvolution. This article focuses on the lessons learned by researchers engaged in PDD in the pharmaceutical industry and considers the impact of 'omics' knowledge in defining a cellular disease phenotype in the era of precision medicine, introducing the concept of a chain of translatability. We particularly aim to identify features and areas in which PDD can best deliver value to drug discovery portfolios and can contribute to the identification and the development of novel medicines, and to illustrate the challenges and uncertainties that are associated with PDD in order to help set realistic expectations with regard to its benefits and costs.",0.0,Opportunities and challenges in phenotypic drug discovery: an industry perspective.,0.0,"Moffat JG, Vincent F, Lee JA, Eder J, Prunotto M",,0.0,,10/10/17 0:00,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.1038/nrd.2017.111,8,Nature Reviews Drug Discovery,,28685762.0,,531-543,155.0,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,16,2017.0,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"PURPOSE: Prostate cancer was recently classified to three clinically relevant subtypes (PCS) demarcated by unique pathway activation and clinical aggressiveness. In this preclinical study, we investigated molecular targets and therapeutics for PCS1, the most aggressive and lethal subtype with no treatment options available in the clinic.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We utilized the PCS1 gene set and our model of enzalutamide (ENZR) castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) to identify targetable pathways and inhibitors for PCS1. The findings were evaluated in vitro and ENZR CRPC xenograft model in vivo.
RESULTS: The results revealed that ENZR CRPC cells are enriched with PCS1 signature and that Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) pathway is the central driver of this subtype. Notably, we identified Monensin as a novel FOXM1 binding agent that selectively targets FOXM1 to reverse the PCS1 signature and its associated stem-like features and reduces the growth of ENZR CRPC cells and xenograft tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preclinical data indicate FOXM1 pathway as a master regulator of PCS1 tumours, namely in ENZR CRPC, and targeting FOXM1 reduces cell growth and stemness in ENZR CRPC in vitro and in vivo.

"Organic chemists are able to synthesize molecules in greater number and chemical complexity than ever before.

Here, we demonstrate this concept by synthesizing ten triads of constitutionally isomeric compounds via complexity-generating photochemical and thermal rearrangements and measuring compound-induced changes in cellular morphology via an imaging-based \""cell painting\"" assay.

"High throughput mRNA expression profiling can be used to characterize the response of cell culture models to perturbations such as pharmacologic modulators and genetic perturbations. As profiling campaigns expand in scope, it is important to homogenize, summarize, and analyze the resulting data in a manner that captures significant biological signals in spite of various noise sources such as batch effects and stochastic variation. We used the L1000 platform for large-scale profiling of 978 representative genes across thousands of compound treatments. Here, a method is described that uses deep learning techniques to convert the expression changes of the landmark genes into a perturbation barcode that reveals important features of the underlying data, performing better than the raw data in revealing important biological insights. The barcode captures compound structure and target information, and predicts a compound's high throughput screening promiscuity, to a higher degree than the original data measurements, indicating that the approach uncovers underlying factors of the expression data that are otherwise entangled or masked by noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate that visualizations derived from the perturbation barcode can be used to more sensitively assign functions to unknown compounds through a guilt-by-association approach, which we use to predict and experimentally validate the activity of compounds on the MAPK pathway.

"Current pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are ineffective in a significant proportion of patients, and the identification of new antidepressant compounds has been difficult. 'Connectivity mapping' is a method that can be used to identify drugs that elicit similar downstream effects on mRNA levels when compared to current treatments, and thus may point towards possible repositioning opportunities. We investigated genome-wide transcriptomic changes to human hippocampal progenitor cells treated with therapeutically relevant concentrations of a tricyclic antidepressant (nortriptyline) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram). We identified mRNA changes common to both drugs to create an 'antidepressant mRNA signature'. We used this signature to probe the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) and to identify other compounds that elicit similar changes to mRNA in neural progenitor cells. Results from LINCS revealed that the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine elicited mRNA changes most similar to our mRNA signature, and we identified W-7 and vorinostat as functionally relevant drug candidates, which may have repositioning potential.

"Morphine, an effective but addictive analgesic, can profoundly affect the inflammatory response to pathogens, and long-term use can result in morphine tolerance. Inflammasomes are protein complexes involved in the inflammatory response. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) Family Pyrin Domain Containing (NLRP) 12 (NLRP12) inflammasome has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we examined the expression of NLRP12 inflammasome related genes in the adult F344 rat brain in response to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence and absence of morphine tolerance. Morphine tolerance was elicited using the 2 + 4 morphine-pelleting protocol. On Day 1, the rats were pelleted subcutaneously with 2 pellets of morphine (75 mg/pellet) or a placebo; on Days 2 and 4 pellets were given. On Day 5, the animals were randomly assigned to receive either 250 µg/kg LPS or saline (i.p.). The expression of 84 inflammasome related genes in the rat brain was examined using a Ploymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) array. In response to LPS, there was a significant increase in the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine genes interleukin-1 beta (Il-1β), interleukin-6 (Il-6), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2), C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (Ccl7), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (Cxcl1), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (Cxcl3) and a significant decrease in the anti-inflammatory NLRP12 gene in both morphine-tolerant and placebo-control rats compared to saline-treated rats, although the changes were greater in the placebo-control animals. The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures' (LINCS) connectivity map was used to analyze the list of affected genes to identify potential targets associated with the interactions of LPS and morphine tolerance. Our data indicate that, in the morphine tolerant state, the expression of NLRP12 and its related genes is altered in response to LPS and that the Vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 28 (VPS28), which is involved in the transport and sorting of proteins into sub-cellular vesicles, may be the key regulator of these alterations.",0.0,NLRP12 inflammasome expression in the rat brain in response to LPS during morphine tolerance.,0.0,"Chang SL Huang W, Mao X, Sarkar S",,0.0,,3/30/17 0:00,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.3390/brainsci7020014,2,Brain Sciences,,28178176.0,PMC5332957,E14,129.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,7,2017.0,PMC5332957,[],0.0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play multiple roles in tumor biology. Interestingly, reports from multiple groups suggest that miRNA targets may be coupled through competitive stoichiometric sequestration. Specifically, computational models predicted and experimental assays confirmed that miRNA activity is dependent on miRNA target abundance, and consequently, changes in the abundance of some miRNA targets lead to changes to the regulation and abundance of their other targets. The resulting indirect regulatory influence between miRNA targets resembles competition and has been dubbed competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Recent studies have questioned the physiological relevance of ceRNA interactions, our ability to accurately predict these interactions, and the number of genes that are impacted by ceRNA interactions in specific cellular contexts.
RESULTS: To address these concerns, we reverse engineered ceRNA networks (ceRNETs) in breast and prostate adenocarcinomas using context-specific TCGA profiles, and tested whether ceRNA interactions can predict the effects of RNAi-mediated gene silencing perturbations in PC3 and MCF7 cells._ENREF_22 Our results, based on tests of thousands of inferred ceRNA interactions that are predicted to alter hundreds of cancer genes in each of the two tumor contexts, confirmed statistically significant effects for half of the predicted targets.

"Melanoma of the uveal tract accounts for approximately 5% of all melanomas and represents the most common primary intraocular malignancy. Despite improvements in diagnosis and more effective local therapies for primary cancer, the rate of metastatic death has not changed in the past forty years. In the present study, we made use of bioinformatics to analyze the data obtained from three public available microarray datasets on uveal melanoma in an attempt to identify novel putative chemotherapeutic options for the liver metastatic disease. We have first carried out a meta-analysis of publicly available whole-genome datasets, that included data from 132 patients, comparing metastatic vs. non metastatic uveal melanomas, in order to identify the most relevant genes characterizing the spreading of tumor to the liver. Subsequently, the L1000CDS2 web-based utility was used to predict small molecules and drugs targeting the metastatic uveal melanoma gene signature. The most promising drugs were found to be Cinnarizine, an anti-histaminic drug used for motion sickness, Digitoxigenin, a precursor of cardiac glycosides, and Clofazimine, a fat-soluble iminophenazine used in leprosy.

"BACKGROUND: Due to advances in next generation sequencing technologies and corresponding reductions in cost, it is now attainable to investigate genome-wide gene expression and variants at a patient-level, so as to better understand and anticipate heterogeneous responses to therapy. Consequently, it is feasible to inform personalized drug treatment decisions using personal genomics data. However, these efforts are limited due to a lack of reliable computational approaches for predicting effective drugs for individual patients. The reverse gene set enrichment analysis (i.e., connectivity mapping) approach and its variants have been widely and successfully used for drug prediction. However, the performance of these methods is limited by undefined mechanism of action (MoA) of drugs and reliance on cohorts of patients rather than personalized predictions for individual patients.
RESULTS: In this study, we have developed and evaluated a computational approach, known as Mechanism and Drug Miner (MD-Miner), using a network-based computational approach to predict effective drugs and reveal potential drug mechanisms of action at the level of signaling pathways. Specifically, the patient-specific signaling network is constructed by integrating known disease associated genes with patient-derived gene expression profiles. In parallel, a drug mechanism of action network is constructed by integrating drug targets and z-score profiles of drug-induced gene expression (pre vs. post-drug treatment). Potentially effective candidate drugs are prioritized according to the number of common genes between the patient-specific dysfunctional signaling network and drug MoA network. We evaluated the MD-Miner method on the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, and showed that it significantly improved the success rate of discovering effective drugs compared with the random selection, and could provide insight into potential mechanisms of action.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a signaling network-based drug repositioning approach. Compared with the reverse gene signature based drug repositioning approaches, the proposed method can provide clues of mechanism of action in terms of signaling transduction networks.",1.0,MD-Miner: a network-based approach for personalized drug repositioning.,0.0,"Wu H, Miller E, Wijegunawardana D, Regan K, Payne PRO, Li F",,0.0,,10/10/17 0:00,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.1186/s12918-017-0462-9,86,BMC Systems Biology,,28984195.0,,,161.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,11(Suppl 5),2017.0,PMC5629618,[],0.0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Inferring genetic networks from genome-wide expression data is extremely demanding computationally. We have developed fastBMA, a distributed, parallel, and scalable implementation of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for this purpose. fastBMA also includes a computationally efficient module for eliminating redundant indirect edges in the network by mapping the transitive reduction to an easily solved shortest-path problem. We evaluated the performance of fastBMA on synthetic data and experimental genome-wide time series yeast and human datasets. When using a single CPU core, fastBMA is up to 100 times faster than the next fastest method, LASSO, with increased accuracy. It is a memory-efficient, parallel, and distributed application that scales to human genome-wide expression data. A 10 000-gene regulation network can be obtained in a matter of hours using a 32-core cloud cluster (2 nodes of 16 cores). fastBMA is a significant improvement over its predecessor ScanBMA. It is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster than other fast network inference methods such as the 1 based on LASSO. The improved scalability allows it to calculate networks from genome scale data in a reasonable time frame. The transitive reduction method can improve accuracy in denser networks. fastBMA is available as code (M.I.T. license) from GitHub (https://github.com/lhhunghimself/fastBMA), as part of the updated networkBMA Bioconductor package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/networkBMA.html) and as ready-to-deploy Docker images (https://hub.docker.com/r/biodepot/fastbma/).",1.0,fastBMA: scalable network inference and transitive reduction.,0.0,"Hung LH, Shi K, Wu M, Young WC, Raftery AE, Yeung KY",,0.0,,10/18/17 0:00,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.1093/gigascience/gix078,10,Gigascience,,29020744.0,PMC5632288 ,10-Jan,168.0,"{\fastBMA source code\"":\""https://github.com/lhhunghimself/fastBMA\""}""",0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,6,2017.0,PMC5632288,[],0.0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The associations between clinical phenotypes (tumor grade, survival) and cell phenotypes, such as shape, signaling activity, and gene expression, are the basis for cancer pathology, but the mechanisms explaining these relationships are not always clear. The generation of large data sets containing information regarding cell phenotypes and clinical data provides an opportunity to describe these mechanisms. Here, we develop an image-omics approach to integrate quantitative cell imaging data, gene expression, and protein-protein interaction data to systematically describe a \shape-gene network\"" that couples specific aspects of breast cancer cell shape to signaling and transcriptional events. The actions of this network converge on NF-κB, and support the idea that NF-κB is responsive to mechanical stimuli. By integrating RNAi screening data, we identify components of the shape-gene network that regulate NF-κB in response to cell shape changes. This network was also used to generate metagene models that predict NF-κB activity and aspects of morphology such as cell area, elongation, and protrusiveness. Critically, these metagenes also have predictive value regarding tumor grade and patient outcomes. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that changes in cell shape, driven by gene expression and/or mechanical forces, can promote breast cancer progression by modulating NF-κB activation.

"Poorly differentiated (PD) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a worse prognosis compared to moderately differentiated (MD) and well differentiated (WD) HCC. We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to explore the mechanism of PD HCC.

Further RT-PCR was performed to validate DEGs specific for PD HCC in 47 pairs of samples (15 for PD, 18 for MD, 14 for WD). A total of 681 PD DEGs were detected, including 368 up-regulated and 313 down-regulated genes. Less DEGs were found for MD and especially for WD HCC. Through bioinformatics analysis, PD HCC DEGs were enriched in liver tissue and liver cancer cells, and in biological process and pathway including metabolism, cell cycle, translation and blood coagulation. Potential drugs and genetic perturbations were found to reverse the cancer condition. The RT-PCR results showed consistency with RNA-seq in the validation of 4 DEGs specific for PD HCC.

"Epidemiological studies indicate that patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease have a lower risk of developing lung cancer, and suggest a higher risk of developing glioblastoma. Here we explore the molecular scenarios that might underlie direct and inverse co-morbidities between these diseases. Transcriptomic meta-analyses reveal significant numbers of genes with inverse patterns of expression in Alzheimer's disease and lung cancer, and with similar patterns of expression in Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma. These observations support the existence of molecular substrates that could at least partially account for these direct and inverse co-morbidity relationships. A functional analysis of the sets of deregulated genes points to the immune system, up-regulated in both Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma, as a potential link between these two diseases. Mitochondrial metabolism is regulated oppositely in Alzheimer's disease and lung cancer, indicating that it may be involved in the inverse co-morbidity between these diseases.

"The availability of increasing volumes of multi-omics profiles across many cancers promises to improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying cancer. The main challenge is to integrate these multiple levels of omics profiles and especially to analyze them across many cancers.

First, AMARETTO identifies potential cancer driver genes through integration of copy number, DNA methylation and gene expression data. Then AMARETTO connects these driver genes with co-expressed target genes that they control, defined as regulatory modules. Thirdly, we connect AMARETTO modules identified from different cancer sites into a pancancer network to identify cancer driver genes. Here we applied AMARETTO in a pancancer study comprising eleven cancer sites and confirmed that AMARETTO captures hallmarks of cancer.

"The alcohol research field has amassed an impressive number of gene expression datasets spanning key brain areas for addiction, species (humans as well as multiple animal models), and stages in the addiction cycle (binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative effect, and preoccupation/anticipation). These data have improved our understanding of the molecular adaptations that eventually lead to dysregulation of brain function and the chronic, relapsing disorder of addiction. Identification of new medications to treat alcohol use disorder (AUD) will likely benefit from the integration of genetic, genomic, and behavioral information included in these important datasets. Systems pharmacology considers drug effects as the outcome of the complex network of interactions a drug has rather than a single drug-molecule interaction. Computational strategies based on this principle that integrate gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals and disease states have shown promise for identifying treatments that ameliorate disease symptoms (called in silico gene mapping or connectivity mapping). In this review, we suggest that gene expression profiling for in silico mapping is critical to improve drug repurposing and discovery for AUD and other psychiatric illnesses.

"Motivation
Availability of large-scale genomic, epigenetic and proteomic data in complex diseases makes it possible to objectively and comprehensively identify therapeutic targets that can lead to new therapies. The Connectivity Map has been widely used to explore novel indications of existing drugs. However, the prediction accuracy of the existing methods, such as Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic remains low. Here we present a novel high-performance drug repositioning approach that improves over the state-of-the-art methods.

Results
We first designed an expression weighted cosine method (EWCos) to minimize the influence of the uninformative expression changes and then developed an ensemble approach termed EMUDRA (Ensemble of Multiple Drug Repositioning Approaches) to integrate EWCos and three existing state-of-the-art methods. EMUDRA significantly outperformed individual drug repositioning methods when applied to simulated and independent evaluation datasets. We predicted using EMUDRA and experimentally validated an antibiotic rifabutin as an inhibitor of cell growth in triple negative breast cancer.

We classified 31 drugs with availability of DEGs into 13 toxic and 18 nontoxic drugs based on a clinical cardiomyopathy incidence cutoff of 0.1%.

"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces a wide variety of cellular and molecular changes that can continue for days to weeks to months, leading to functional impairments. Currently, there are no pharmacotherapies in clinical use that favorably modify the post-TBI outcome, due in part to limited understanding of the mechanisms of TBI-induced pathologies. Our system biology analysis tested the hypothesis that chronic transcriptomics changes induced by TBI are controlled by altered DNA-methylation in gene promoter areas or by transcription factors. We performed genome-wide methyl binding domain (MBD)-sequencing (seq) and RNA-seq in perilesional, thalamic, and hippocampal tissue sampled at 3 months after TBI induced by lateral fluid percussion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. We investigated the regulated molecular networks and mechanisms underlying the chronic regulation, particularly DNA methylation and transcription factors. Finally, we identified compounds that modulate the transcriptomics changes and could be repurposed to improve recovery. Unexpectedly, DNA methylation was not a major regulator of chronic post-TBI transcriptomics changes. On the other hand, the transcription factors Cebpd, Pax6, Spi1, and Tp73 were upregulated at 3 months after TBI (False discovery rate < 0.05), which was validated using digital droplet polymerase chain reaction. Transcription regulatory network analysis revealed that these transcription factors regulate apoptosis, inflammation, and microglia, which are well-known contributors to secondary damage after TBI. Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) analysis identified 118 pharmacotherapies that regulate the expression of Cebpd, Pax6, Spi1, and Tp73. Of these, the antidepressant and/or antipsychotic compounds trimipramine, rolipramine, fluspirilene, and chlorpromazine, as well as the anti-cancer therapies pimasertib, tamoxifen, and vorinostat were strong regulators of the identified transcription factors, suggesting their potential to modulate the regulated transcriptomics networks to improve post-TBI recovery.",0.0,"Transcription factors Tp73, Cebpd, Pax6, and Spi1 rather than DNA methylation regulate chronic transcriptomics changes after experimental traumatic brain injury.",0.0,"Lipponen A, El-Osta A, Kaspi A, Ziemann M, Khurana I, Kn H, Navarro-Ferrandis V, Puhakka N, Paananen J, Pitkanen A",,0.0,,3/5/18 0:00,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,10.1186/s40478-018-0519-z,1,Acta Neuropathologica Communications,,29482641.0,PMC5828078,17,204.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,6,2018.0,PMC5828078,[],0.0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
